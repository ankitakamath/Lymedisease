i see so many new posters who seem to be using their real names. some post a first initial with what seems to be a real last name. even a first name and last initial can be traced, too.  to do so is extremely dangerous regarding privacy issues. even if you don't mind the world knowing you have (or may have lyme), insurance companies do search patients' names. most insurance companies do not want to pay for lyme treatment - at all.  also, some life insurance companies will not cover someone who has had lyme.  i don't know if one can re-register with another web name. but, if you see this before you sign up, please use a screen name that no one can figure out. privacy concerns run deep.  anyone can search a name and if it's here at lymenet, it can show up with a web search for years to come. same with most web sites.  never post your real name, address, phone, names of family members or even the exact ages of your children on any public site. it's best to not post any particulars about your children as some who read all public sites can be searching for those who are vulnerable. not everyone who reads this site is someone who wants to help. it is a public site.  all that said, most here are very helpful and here to make the world a better place, keeping your personal safety in mind along the way. -  ** moderator's note - to change your name, you need to contact jenifer, the other moderators are not able to change it for you **  [ 07-10-2010, 12:32 pm: message edited by: sixgoofykids ]^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

ok able to read some of the posts. i was told i had a bacteria infection when the fnp did a urine test for diabetes.  so took 2 cipro. one yesterday and one this am. do not want to take a 3rd.  so what do we take.  i have had increased back pain which i read maybe from urinary track infection plus increased over all pain which i thought was due to being back in the apartment vs being at the hotel...but not so sure now.  i have zithro from last the first time i visited the fnp. i had that dry cough thing that i have had for years when the body is running on empty.  she thought i had walking pneumonia or something so prescribed the zithro which i purchased but did not take.  i have had cabteria in my urine off and on since college. back then i would not get the abx tha twas prescribed as they made me worse.  i would go back for the check up visit and get a clean urine test...so did not put much improtance on the bacteria in the urine thing...unless it hurtt to pee ..then yes..took the abx.  i always got the uti and it hurt to pee after i had sex with husband. got where i did not want ot have sex with him nor did i end up even liking him.  so wondering if that along with ohter symptoms that came and went were because he had lyme disease and was passing it on to me??  so much more needs to be studied with this condition.  docs at the time said i had depression but the anti depresive meds made me depressed.^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"- it would be important to know the size and composition of this (if that's possible to know).  your doctor should be able to help guide in regarding if holding off on the lithotripsy could put you at risk regarding the urgency of getting it ""out"" or diminished from possible ability to cut from inside or it if might become lodged in urinary tract, etc.  possible bruising might be the least of things to consider -- yet i would think your doctor has already gone over the pros and cons of waiting, i hope.  be sure to tell your doctor of what else you might be doing / thinking about as it is important to keep them in the loop and give them the chance to weigh in.  if, at all possible, best to have an n.d. consult on this. a n.d. would also be able to better guide you on any possible alternate options &/or what might also help along with lithotripsy procedure if that seems the best approach.  the thing is, too, that not all kidney stones have the same composition. if you pass some / all of this, it's important to try to ""catch"" it and have it examined. that will help to guide your diet or other proactive / preventative measures moving forward, etc.  good luck. -"^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"- many herbs that help with blood pressure or glycemic load are adaptogens in nature and work more to balance, to modulate for what is needed at that time for the person.  i have nmh, a kind of low blood pressure yet i find most herbs that have blood pressure lowing properties do not affect me that way (though one medical mushroom that starts with ""g"" sure turned out not to be right for me).  chanca piedra will cause some pretty profound relaxation as that's just part of its nature. it's good to know that so that you'd be home relaxing and not out driving, etc. when taking at doses for acute issues. still, best to have an nd advice.   also to consider: pain will play havoc, sheer havoc, with blood pressure.  as you study up on those herbs suggested - or find a good nd, you may find that the ones to consider would be fine - or another way to approach.  also consider that - if you are laid up with an acute kidney stone, you're not going to be out driving or running around. you're likely going to be lying down and rather out of commission anyway.  if the herbs considered are not adaptogenic in that way, you would be in a position to manage by lying down (or eating smaller meals more often, getting in a little sea salt, etc) until the acute issue resolves. -"^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"when i had lyme, i choked on my own saliva regularly. this was while awake.  i believe that lyme often affects the ""flap"" that is to cover the windpipe so that no saliva goes down it. it seems the flap would not close well, so if i had my head back, the saliva would go into the windpipe and cause a horrendous coughing fit that would last 15 minutes and scare all my office coworkers.  never had the other symptoms you mention. i had extreme muscle weakness as my main problem for 10 years. i could only stand for 1 minute, hold the phone to my head 30 seconds, and couldn't hold my mouth open to have my teeth cleaned.  all my symptoms went away when i switched to a burrascano type doctor. it is now about 12 1/2 years since i completed my lyme treatment and i am still symptom free, enjoying my life.  i was rebitten about 3 years after my cure and went back to the same doc and got 30 days of excellent treatment with 3 antibiotics. it worked!"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
breaking up the above post for easier reading by all:   i was just recently diagnosed but only have bands 31 and 41, as well as an indeterminate for 39.  it started in september with pins and needles in my hands and feet, feeling faint, and my heart racing for four days straight. i thought i was having a stroke!  i had these feelings before in the previous year but only on the 4 or 5 times... when i drank or did botox?my regular pcp put me on two weeks of doxy and all hell broke loose...  my fingers started twitching, then muscle cramps/weakness and extreme exhaustion. he took me off the doxy saying the cdc only recommends two weeks...(he�d only given it to me since i informed him i had picked many a tick off of myself and my dog this summer.)  now i�m back on doxy after a 5 week break and i cannot tell if my symptoms are worsening or staying the same. i do know my anxiety is through the roof!!!!  nights are the worst i had to start taking medication for sleep and anxiety. i believe it�s one for parkinsons patients.  anyhow, i have an emg scheduled in feb as i did have some hyperintensities come up on an mri. has anyone else had lyme show up in an mri? so frightened right now!  and i just want these tremors, muscle cramps, and arthritic pain to go away!!!!^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

i finally have gotten a positive test for bartonella henselae igg after 12 years of failed lyme treatments. i always suspected it, but, could never get a positive, so i have never been treated.  my primary wanted to put me on levaquin, but, i was afraid. i talked her into rifampin 300mg twice a day, combined with zithromax 250mg twice a day. i have read that this is a good combo, but, would love to hear personal experiences on abx regimens for bart.  my primary also wants my to see dr. h in ny, but, i just can't afford it. so, i'm trying to get her to prescribe the necessary treatment.  i have almost all the lyme syptoms on the list, and lately the internal buzzing/shaking with joint cracking and pain has been off the charts. i am not currently treating.  my son has bart and finished 7 months of babs treatment (+ blood test) with a mepron/zith combo in aug. he was also taking abart and continued on it alone. his rash, which had gotten slightly better, has gotten worse after stopping the mepron/zith.  i don't think that the abart did anything, and that it was the zithromax that had helped the rash fade slightly. so, doc put him on rifampin/zith combo (150 2xs/day dose of rifampin for children)  anyway, i'm hoping that this combo will help us both. i'm trying not to get my hopes up, but, i'm so excited. a positive finally! and, my son is seronegative, but, he has the rash, so he definitely has it.  any input would be appreciated. thanks.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
rifampin, zithro and tindamax has been my most helpful combo.  rifampin does effect the availability of other meds such as thyroid sleep etc.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"hello all,  as my user name suggests, i am - highly - distressed.  over the past year and a half, i have watched my wife deteriorate before my very eyes. what was was once an extremely vibrant and vivacious woman in her mid-50s, is now a shell of her former self.  she suffers from a laundry list of symptoms, including, but certainly not limited to:  loss of muscle tone and dexterity in feet and hands;  constant pain throughout her body;  hour-long episodes (many days, multiple times per day) of sweats that, by time they end, she is drenched like she has just come out of the pool, and i can literraly wring out her clothing and the sheets and blankets;  weakness;  loss of appetite (and occasional nausea);  severe anxiety;  depression;  never wants to go out of the house, et al  additionally, she suffers from constant infections in her mouth due a botched oral surgery (implants) from three years ago, and has a variety of problems with knees, shoulders, back, from a car accident and skiing accident that occurred over 25 years ago.  i have have her to neurologists, rheumatologists, pain management, ent specialists, infectious disease doctors, etc.  we always come out with a result something along the lines of: ""i think she may have...rheumatory arthritis; psoriatic arthritis; fybromyalgia; pdeudo-gout""...and on and on the list goes, with not one doctor able to say that she has something specific.  i recently read an article about lyme's, and light bulbs flashed in front of me! i'm now led to believe that she may very well be suffering from lyme's.  over the course of the past week, i have read and researched on this topic, and lyme literate mds in my general area (with lists of names provided by ilads).  i've reached out to many of these doctors, and have found that it is months to get an appointment, and that - so far - none of them accept insurance. i understand the insurance game, now that i've read the ""why lyme doctors don't take insurance"" post on this board.  what i would really like to find out is board members experiences (recommend or not recommend) with various llmds in the new jersey/new york area - and why they would, or would not recommend - a certain doctor. i ask this, because i believe that time is of the essence to help my wife.  i thank you for welcoming me to this board, letting me tell my wife's story, letting me reach out for help (which is something i rarely do), and thank you in advance to all who reply to my plea.  sincerely,  distressed"^1^1^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^1^0

i recently took my first dose of flagyl in almost over a year. the first time i took flagyl i took the dr, recommemded dose of 500 mg 2 times a day for two days. i was herxing my butt off, soo miserable. it has taken me this long to get the nerve to take the meds again. i took a half a pill on sat night, herxing was tolerable.  about a week and a half after the original dose of flagyl i had about 5 good days in a row, i felt almost normal!! i keep a journal and repeatedly looked over what i did during that time trying to see what had made the difference. i had retried everything again except the flagyl and i am hoping it was the flagyl that made a difference once the herx was over.  how long or at what dose have u guys noticed a difference on flagyl?^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
hello, i have some questions for you all. i have not been diagnosed with lyme but i just had a bunch of tests ran and am looking for some advice. i had something called a cd57 panel done and both of those results came back low. i had a lot of other tests done which all came back negative or normal except for the cd57 and m pnuemoniae which was slightly elevated. my doctor said i do not have lyme, which i am hoping is true, but i am wondering what else this could indicate? i do have ankylosing spondylitis but that is the only diagnosis i have. any feedback or thoughts would be helpful.. i have not been feeling well for months, with weird symptoms and am trying to figure it out.  thanks!^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"essential fatty acids are critical to brain function. fish oil is the best source.  diet needs to be primarily proteins, fats, & above-ground veggies like boxermom said (no root veggies, no fruits, no sugars, no grains).  should also avoid artificial sweeteners, as these can trick the brain into thinking blood sugar is low.  stevia and xylitol are safe sweeteners because they have no impact on blood sugar levels, nor do they feed candida.  eat protein every 2 hours between meals (unless sleeping). nuts/seeds make excellent snacks.  chromium is needed for keeping blood sugar levels balanced.  be careful with ala and some other supplements & herbs, they may lower blood sugar levels.  watch out for sugars/carbs in supplements & medications (most tablet/capsule meds use starch fillers; most liquid meds use sugar or artificial sweeteners).  may need other nutritional supplements - especially vitamin b complex.  may also consider looking into methylation issues, as methylation can have an effect on blood sugar regulation and also neurotransmitters (brain function)...  google ""dr. amy yasko methylation"" (not an llmd) or check out http://www.heartfixer.com/amri-nutrigenomics.htm for more info on methylation.  -------------------- -razzle lyme igm igenex pos. 18+++, 23-25+, 30++, 31+, 34++, 39 ind, 83-93 ind; igg igenex neg. 30+, 39 ind; mayo/cdc pos. igm 23+, 39+; igg mayo/cdc neg. band 41+; bart.

my doctor prescribed doxy combined with flagyl for a tick bite for my son. i sent the tick to igenex and tested lyme and all coinfections. tick was positive for lyme, negative for coinfections.  my son tested positive for babesia, and negative for lyme after the preventative treatment. i would definitely use extra doxy to extend the treatment.  these docs have no problem prescribing abx for acne, but, won't give an adequate dose for a disease that can ruin someone's life. it's just unbelievable.  someone posted this page for me when my son was bit. good info... http://www.treatthebite.com/^0^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

lymetoo, she *guarantees* it's a cure. but the diet is really hard. you have to stay on it 3 months to a year depending on the severity of your candida. there are several phases to the diet as well, along with 7 principles of healing (detox, enemas, etc.) so to do the whole thing and do it right is a task. you could ease your way into by first cutting out gluten, then sugar, then dairy, etc. which you may already do. i need to learn more about the whole grains, quinoa, amararith, etc. that are allowed so i can get off all bad carbs completely. i am going to look into the gap diet this weekend and look at the similarities/differences of the bed diet.  last time, when i only did the bed diet for 2 months (and mediocre at that), my chemical sensitivities started going away. she also claims it helps many other types of immune dysfunction. i guess because so much of the immune is in the gut. good luck!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

i took levoquin for coinfections. from about the 3 or 4th dose, i felt like something was wrong.  i had burning in my shins, pain in the sole of my feet, a feeling of total weakness in my legs--as if i didn't have the strength to even walk.  i stopped taking it. somehow, it didn't feel okay for me to take another dose.  my llmd prescribed rifampin. not the same side effects at all, and hopefully it's effectively targeting the coinfections.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"hi! about 6 years ago, i was soooooooo sick from lyme that my husband drove me down to the beach in oct. and i sat and cried thinking i would not live to see another summer! after 8 months of iv and oral abx my life slowly returned to normal. that includes going out dancing, summers on the beach, vacations like ""normal"" people, and working all day without falling off my feet. i attribute it to a great llmd,(dr. b), better diet, and active strength training and exercise as soon as i was well enough. (had to start with physical therapy!) . i am not perfect because when symptoms return i go back on abx(oral), like now. but if you have a good llmd, you will catch it before the symptoms get out of hand, and continue to lead a good life. hope this has helped someone.  -------------------- to win this battle, make the time for exercise and fitness activities! there is no shortcut to any place worth going! pegee4"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"hey, that was my story way back almost 4 years ago in the original thread! i've come a long way since then. i was still living with my daughter then (who'd cared for me when i was so sick i was an invalid), though my life was starting to come back.  now i own my own home again: i bought a semi-derelict house a couple of years ago, and though it still needs a lot of work, it's warm, comfortable, and mine. i garden (my goal is to substitute flowers for as much grass as possible). kinda behind on the actual fix-the-house stuff.  i work part-time at my old profession and love it. i research and write scientific white papers and monitoring plans for the agency i work for, and coordinate projects that involve a bunch of people. to think that five years ago i could only look at pictures in magazines, and could barely follow a conversation with one other person.  from time to time, i get to go out in the field-- this means hiking rough trails in back-country or snowshoeing into remote locations in the winter. this is the part i like best. (not an indoor type of person.) you better believe i do very thorough tick checks when i get back!  i go places for fun. i join friends for dinner. i have ""overnights"" with my granddaughter, and sometimes we all go on outings. always an artist in the background, i got hooked on creating fused art glass, and set up a studio in my basement. it's a passion with a long learning curve, and a lot of satisfaction.  i feel very very fortunate. my life is different from what it might have been, but it is rich and rewarding. since i lost almost all my middle years to lyme, and the last time i felt healthy was my early 40s, i have had to learn from others what is ""normal"" for someone my age. i'm not too far off what other active women are. i still have some limits: i still deal with some leftover cns issues, including migraines, but they are managable with meds.  i get tired, but it is a normal tired, the kind you get over after a good night's sleep. i have not experienced that deep lyme exhaustion for a very long time. nor the brainfog. just the normal kind of gee, where did i leave that? or the odd word that escapes me. what i experience now is the normal sort of thing my never-lymeie co-workers experience (even people a lot younger than me!).  i am not ""cured"". i have been on abx 3 times so far. it is possible that periodically i will need to go back on antibiotics for a while. but i am well. so far, each time i've gone back on abx, my baseline has gotten higher, and i have gotten better than i was before. the remaining cns issues are even starting to resolve. so maybe the time will come that my immune system will be able to do it on its own.  my llmd is holistic, and uses naturopathic and oriental medicine as well as alleopathic. so a very important part of my treatment all along has been to rebuild my immune system and help my neurological system function as well as possible. i take vitamins, minerals, and several herbs to help with that. i exercise, lift weights and do a sort of tai chi (i'm not very good at it, but i try).  most of all, i have learned to set priorities in my life. what is most important to me is keeping peace with mysef and with all that is around me. not holding on to stress or anger. laughing at myself. doing what i can, even a little, to help make the world a better place. sometimes something so simple as waving at a neighbor, giving way to someone in a hurry, fostering a homeless mama cat until a home can be found for her and her kittens.

"i'm finally going to add my sucess story. i got sick in 2002 and went undiagnosed for 9 months. little did i know that after i started treatment for what i thought i only had for 9 months, that ""other symptoms"" that i had for years would disappear as well. i never linked them.  i had severe headpain, head burning, neck pain, back pain, face pain, jaw pain, seizures, spurting nose bleeds, ""jumpy"" muscles, buzzing and twitching, severe vertigo, severe pain in my eyes, throwing up and at times neurogenic bladder. i couldn't think for the life of me ( the fog), would get ringing in my ears, my eye would twitch, you name it, i had it. swollen glands, off and on sore throats, shoulder pain, etc.  at my very worst, right before i got diagnosed, i was having periods of temporary paralysis. i will never forget the day it first hit as i had no clue what was happening to me and thought for sure i was going to die.  i started my abx in april of 2003, i believe, if i am correct.  i did amoxycillin 3000 mg for six months. clindamycin and quinine for six months rifampin for 3 months 600 mg a day biaxin and mepron ( biaxin 1000 mg a day and mepron i literally had to take only 1/4 tsp as it made me very very suicidal and mean) doxycyline for 3 months ceftin for 2 and then bicillin shots for over a year. this in  addition to the diflucan, nystatin, vitamin b12 and host of probiotics and supplements that i took. i also did artemisinin at a very low dose 100 mg per day for a while.  i did take a year break on abx due to leaky gut syndrome and treated that homeopathically.  in addition to the abx, i also did: sauna lemon water detox out the wazoo chiropractors trigger point therapy art testing and followed all that i could on that lymphatic drainage bentonite clay detox baths ""skin brushing"" emotional freedom tapping rife allergy desensitization and much, much more. liver flush   i tested positive for: strep in the blood mycoplasma pneumonia lyme of course ( even cdc positive). the pa health department called me and basically begged me to ""admit"" i didn't get it here in pennsylvania! bartonella pcr positive erlichia came up positive once i was tested for a host of viruses and only came back as having ebv in the past   throughout all of this, my immune system was tested only twice but registered ""in top health"" ba ha ha. but in any case, it was fighting big time.  to be quite honest, the things that helped me the most in this order is:  1.) the amoxicillin took away my brain fog in two weeks flat. yes, it returned from time to time but never like it did previously, and it was my first abx.  2.) leaky gut treatment homeopathically helped me very much. i had leaky gut so bad it gave me orthostatic hypotension. i did not have it previously at any point, but developed it due to all the abx in my system.  3.) these aren't in order- but art testing and allergy desensitization turned my world and my health around. if i hadn't went that route ( and i was 2 and a half years into treatment), i doubt i would be well today.  4.) liver flushes. ( this actually kick started me losing alot of weight. i was 155, now im 128 and digging around looking for smaller jeans ""pre lyme"" in my closet).  5.) bicillin. bicillin did the trick at pushing me into remission.  6.) diflucan- turned my life around as well.  this remission for me: i don't really flare anymore but i still do get desparately ill around my period, for one to two days. i actually know it is coming because i will sweat under my underarms bad , and soak through my clothes. note:  pre lyme treatment, i had this ""hyperhydrosis"" for 10 years straight. now, i have it once a month. so i know its something that i did that helped it, so i have to keep chugging on.  i can pretty much eat what i want to , but my body does not tolerate pasta, soda/pop of any nature or tomatoes. potatos also make me gravely ill. food actually induces brain fog.  i just graduated finally and fully two weeks ago from college. my last day there, a gift was given to me- i felt completely normal and the orthostatic hypotension didn't kick in at all.  i still suffer from orthostatic hypotension, some sleep apnea, and period flares as i said. i still have some ""neuro rage"" left and my vision i believe is permanently screwed up thanks to lyme.  i have undergone nothing and i do mean nothing but stress this entire year, from getting engaged, to him cheating on me 17 days later, to my sister stealing money from me, to contemplating moving, etc. and i haven't relapsed. i also had a concussion in early june. i actually did relapse over that but bounced back in under a month.  keep on going people, it will happen for ya. it took me 3, almost 4 years) and mind you a year off from abx, but im still here.  in the end, it was the alternative/adjunct treatments that saved me. the abx were a necessary evil though. i wouldnt have made it without them.  but now i mainly sweep up their afteraffects.  wishign you all happy holidays!  -------------------- you want your life back? take it."^0^1^1^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0

(i don't know if i'd always agree on that one, but you know.)  i read a lot, ride my bike all through winters in pittsburgh, and i've gotten into refinishing furniture. pick up the guitar once in a while. i help my friends move cuz i have a station wagon (avast ye!)...hmm, what else? oh i've gotten back into acting again, here and there. i don't go out of my way for that though. spent some time (a summer) at uc berkeley. saw the white stripes there, the saturday after my classes ended. it was hott. i love renaissance playwrights. i furnished my entire living room for free, which includes a 27 inch telly and a futon.  in the last three and a half years since coming to college, i've been quiet about when i was sick - i needed some time under the radar. but now i'm beginning to feel like opening up to more people. i feel like i could do a lot, i'm not sure what, but why not give it a go? anyone know anything about activism in western pa / pittsburgh?  things are crisp.  -------------------- ""it comes as no surprise, just leave the light on."""^0^0^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
finally, success!  i'm a frequent reader of this board, but haven't really posted much. i wanted to post my success story to share with everyone and let you know there's hope of getting better, it can happen.  i was diagnosed with lyme in may 2007 after being sick with strange symptoms for about 6 months. dizziness, jaw pain, confusion, brain fog, forgetfulness, arm pain, and extreme fatigue were my main symptoms. i never suspected lyme and was surprised when my doctor, who ran a bunch of tests, told me i had it. (i was one of the lucky ones who test positive)  i grew up in western pa and had heard about lyme disease, but the most i knew about it was something about a bulls-eye rash. i wasn't prepared for how sick i was about to get!  i'm so thankful to everyone on this board who provided lifesaving information for me!! you have all educated me about this disease, and about the nasty politics behind treatment. i've been able to pass along that knowledge to everyone i know (even when they don't ask!), and hopefully we can raise awareness about diagnosing and treating lyme.  back to my story - i was diagnosed in may 2007, started on oral antibiotics and sent to an infectious disease doc. i've heard the horror stories about them, but my doctor was amazing!!! he was knowledgeable about the disease and gave me iv rocephin, then continued with the orals after, until i got better.  it took about a year, but i'm so happy to say that i've been symptom-free for 4 months now!! completely healthy. i had gotten to the point where i didn't think this was a possibility - i thought that i would be sick forever.  keep fighting! i know how horrible this disease is, and i want you to know there's a light at the end of the tunnel. thank you to everyone on this board; you are all amazing people struggling with an awful disease. my prayers are with all of you to get better and to be able get back to a normal life. it can happen!^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"yes, my lyme showed up in my brain mri.  it showed up as 2 ubos (unidentified bright objects). the report said that ""lyme cannot be ruled out.""  these ubos are usually areas of hypoperfusion from inadequate bloodflow (caused by lyme which causes inflammation).  i was happy to have this finding as it explained why i felt like i was getting alzheimers!  i was on anxiety meds for years because of undiagnosed lyme (diagnosed as ""menopause."")  now, a brain mri shows no abnormality. so, just know that the effects of lyme on the brain can be reversed with good treatment.  and, i went undiagnosed for at least 10 years!"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

dear spiffy,  please reread tf's posts. best advice.  your immune system produces antibodies to invaders. lyme attacks your immune system and renders its disfunctional.  western blot, tests for antibodies of lyme, not the bacteria itself. if you have a compromised immune system, your body will not produce all antibodies.  this is why lyme warriors are begging for new testing.  idsa doc's will not treat unless you have 5 reactive bands on western blot. and then they will only prescripe a 28 day course of antiboitics and declare you cured.  it's interesting you state that your idsa doc will treat you with negative test. will you please let us know if this comes to fruition ?  there's much you can do while waiting for your llmd.  watch your finances, start saving for llmd and treatments. start lyme diet: no sugar, dairy, flour, wheat, processed meats or foods, alcohol, fruit juices, pork, or vinegar. add lots of wild caught fish, free range beef, chicken and turkey. add lots of organic vegetables.  you could add supplements but most llmd's have their own protocol of what they want you to take.  you need to sleep and rest and keep stress levels low.  expect to be in treatment atleast 1 year, probably longer. (nobody told me this, sure wish they did.)  also, keep fighting for your health. collect and save all data of all tests to show to llmd. this could save you money. you will get answers and you will get better, but not until you see a professional and knowledgable tick borne infection doctor (llmd.)  sorry you are sufferring. welcome to our world friend.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"lyme specialists will order a western blot since it is the preferred test for lyme.  ""in lyme borreliosis, western blot is the preferred serologic test."" (p. 5 of burrascano)  however, non-lyme specialists like you are dealing with will follow the idsa instruction to order an elisa or eia and, if it is positive, then the lab is to do a western blot on the blood sample.  so, based on what you said above, all you got was the elisa screening test which will not show any bands. only the western blot shows band information.  ""the suggestion that two-tiered testing, utilizing an elisa as a screening tool, followed, if positive, by a confirmatory western blot, is illogical in this illness. the elisa is not sensitive enough to serve as an adequate screen, and there are many patients with lyme who test negative by elisa yet have fully diagnostic western blots. i therefore recommend against using the elisa. order igm and igg western blots""  and  ""western blots are reported by showing which bands are reactive."" (p. 7 of burrascano)  this is what routinely happens until a person goes to a lyme doctor who knows to skip the junky elisa. non-lyme specialists are going to adhere to the idsa rules nearly all the time. you can't get a western blot out of them unless you test positive on the elisa first.  this link explains the elisa, a screening test that produces just a ""positive"" or ""negative"" result on igg and igm.  "^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
thanks for that. i see now that elisa can be used to test for igg and igm and that is what the lab probably meant. my expectation is to get the igenex test when i see the llmd in oct.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"well i finally had my appt with my llmd (thanks for the recommendation nancy2). was really nice to speak to someone who understood. i brought all of my previous lab data and medical history.  about a month ago, i saw a neurologist at the recommendation of my pcp, for leg weakness and cognitive things.  he recommended an mri on my lower back, i had them in '06 and '09 and have a herniated disc and others near it bulging. the mri report was not good, my lower spine is basically collapsing/degenerating and pressure on the leg nerves is ""moderate to severe""  the neurologist wouldn't go so far as to say that was the cause of the leg weakness, but it could be. i am on the fence about that.  i have other nerve related things going on related to that that i have learned to live with, but the weakness is new. although it might be a ""perceived"" weakness.  the llmd also noted that the lyme test that the ids did, in fact, included a western blot and it found 3 bands positive in igm and 1 in igg, but, of course ""negative"".  they drew a lot of blood, some will go to a local lab and some to igenx. i was given the option of starting doxy or now or after the labs came back. i decided to start now as it was agreed my response to it would provide another piece of information for the diagnosis.  i will start on probiotics as well as serrapetase. i was told to take magnesium supplements and b-12, but i had already started taking that a few weeks ago based on what i read.  i also had seen my oncologist just a week or two earlier who, when i told him about the elevated ana, kind of perked up and ordered some extra tests.  he, and the llmd recommended a head mri based on some pain symptoms focused on the left side of my head for the last 1+ year, and the llmd is ordering it.  so it will be interesting to see what the blood tests show and if the supplements help any. i am not miserable, but things are not getting better and i just hate not having the energy to do stuff!!

good morning, i am hoping someone can help me with my wb results. i have had lyme symptoms for years and never paid it any mind until my 10 year old daughter tested positive back in april. since then i have been pushing my pcp to test me and finally she did. however both my igm and igg came back negative per cdc. igm showed 0 bands present while igm showed 18, 30, 58 and 93. this would seem like a positive result to me per my knowledge with what i have learned due to my own child. however my pcp won't treat me. my daughter sees an llmd and has a follow up visit with her in december. she doesn't even have any openings until them to see me so i was thinking of at least self treating with a 30 day round of minocycline that i have from my daughter ( an older script but not expired) it seems crazy but i don't know what else to do. looking at my results am i silly to self treat? would you agree it looks like lyme? would love any and all advice before i take the plunge. thank you all!  i should add just to be clear** i'm not taking my child's medication away from her! it is an extra bottle from over the summer that was never used. she has her own meds she takes currently.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"based on the quote from burrascano below, you are positive for lyme disease:  ""western blots are reported by showing which bands are reactive. 41kd bands appear the earliest but can cross react with other spirochetes. the 18kd, 23-25kd (osp c), 31kd (osp a), 34kd (osp b), 37kd, 39kd, 83kd and the 93kd bands are the species-specific ones, but appear later or may not appear at all. you should see at least the 41kd and one of the specific bands. 55kd, 60kd, 66kd, and 73kd are nonspecific and nondiagnostic."" (p. 7)  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  you are positive on band 18 which is specific for lyme and also band 93 which is specific for lyme. so, you are positive on 2 lyme-specific bands. the only way you can be positive on these is that your immune system is fighting lyme disease.  regarding taking some mino now, all the lyme docs i know tell patients not to start taking antibiotics prior to their first appointment unless they have enough antibiotics to last until their appointment.  there is no point in taking antibiotics, then having a break from antibiotics. when you have a break in treatment, the lyme just starts multiplying again, so nothing is to be gained by taking just 30 days of mino. now. also, you have been sick with lyme for so long that i don't see the need to start now.  if you are totally miserable, and you want to do this experiment, it likely won't hurt you. just be sure to first check out the contraindications for mino and the possible side effects.  just know that mino is bacteriostatic (just keeps the lyme from multiplying, but does not kill it) at low doses. you likely would have what is considered a low dose available to you. so, don't expect much to happen. see this burrascano quote:  ""antibiotics there are four types of antibiotics in general use for bb treatment. the tetracyclines, including doxycycline and minocycline, are bacteriostatic unless given in high doses. if high blood levels are not attained, treatment failures in early and late disease are common. however, these high doses can be difficult to tolerate."" (p. 14)  notice that burrascano doesn't even list mino as a drug used to treat lyme. see p. 18 where he lists the meds for lyme and the appropriate dosages for each.  it sounds like your appointment is in 6 to 8 weeks. that is nothing in the lyme world. you are fortunate.  also, to see another doc's take on your lyme test results, read this post on the western blot:  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=042077;p=0  here is a relevant quote from dr. c:  ""in my clinical experience, if a patient has symptoms suspicious for borreliosis, and has one or more of the following bands, there is a very high probability the patient has borreliosis.  these bands are 18, 22, 23-25, 28, 30, 31, 34, 37, 39, 41, 83, and 93.

""  and, finally, regarding your primary care doctor's refusal to treat you for lyme--that is to be expected. you have to go to a lyme specialist to be treated for more than 30 days. so, don't expect a primary care doctor to ""stick his neck out"" for you and violate the infectious diseases society of america lyme treatment guidelines for you.  he wouldn't know how to help you anyway!"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
- http://www.anapsid.org/lyme/lymeseroneg.html  reasons for false negative (seronegative) test results in lyme disease   the way a lyme test is determined to be positive or negative is not by science but by politics of the idsa. the elisa test is a very poor test. a western blot, both igm and igg matter.  the way the idsa decide the way the numbers must line up is just odd. here's what matters most:  lyme is not to be diagnosed by a test. the test helps but what matters most is the clinical presentation, history, etc. then, take into account what ilads llmds look at:  http://drcharlescrist.net/testing-for-borreliosis.html  testing for borreliosis  excerpts:  . . . the numbers on a western blot such as 23, 31, 34 or 39 refer to how much that particular part of the bacteria weighs in kilodaltons.  the significant antibodies, in my opinion, are the 18, 23-25, 28, 30, 31, 34, 39, 59, 66 and 83-93. . . .

"hello all,  in a bit of a pickle here so i was wondering what the thoughts of this forum were. i got the dna connexions (i hate that spelling) done about a month and a half back and just got the results. i am ""nps"" with b. burgdorferi b-osp, b. burgdorferi c-osp, babesia divergens, and bartonella henselae. however i do not know if these are active infections.  i also had an organic acids test done recently which showed some pretty significant mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotransmitter depletion (dopamine) and undermethylation.  i was igenex ind by testing 31kda+++, 41kda++++, and 59kda++++ with positive 31kda igm and igg isotope tests last year. so i got treated by a doctor in co with silver hydrosol, which he claimed would do the job in 4-6 weeks. after taking 2 months of homeopathic drops, he energetically tested me as having no active infection. i was/am skeptical, but his credentials are overtly impressive, so i went with it. the thing is i am much worse right now (4 months after the therapy) than i was to begin with.  so here is the pickle. i'm attempting to pivot and plan my next move. i'm not sure if i see another lyme doctor (the one who gave me the dna connexions test) for a more conventional lyme/co-infections treatment, or a doctor specializing in tackling the organic acid results test.  one one hand, i feel like taking care of the more underlying issues (methylation, neurotransmitters, mitochondria) would put my system back on the map to fight any infection i may have. i also am hesitant to pump a ton of antibiotics in my body. i'm starting to think lyme is becoming a bit of a last resort diagnosis, and all the anti-microbials could do more harm in the long run (organic acid doc's opinion)  on the other hand, if i do have active infections, these could be causing the manifestations of the organic acids results in the first place and perhaps i should take care of this first (lyme doc's opinion). alos, ive tried treatments for methylation/mitochondria etc and they rarely benefit me.  its been 8 years of illness, which resulted in my medical discharge from west point and continuing to delay medical school. i'm trying to get this knocked out as efficiently as possible.  any input is much appreciated i'm stuck treading water here.  thanks very much,"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

foxyloxy have you been able to get ivig started? i was very surprised to get a call recently that ivig was approved. i started it on friday.  a nurse came to my home and infused ivig plasma through my picc line for about 7 hours. i felt okay during the day, other than increase in tinnitus and brain fog. but that night i felt horrible, like i had the flu, but i was doing okay the next morning.  after 2 more days, i am still feeling a bit under the weather (chills, tired, achy...) but no fever and head ache is not severe. i hope this is normal.  my igg and igm levels are lower than they should be, but i don't think i have a primary immune deficiency disease. i need to study up on all of this. i don't know the difference between that and cvid.  my insurance co. won't cover iv abx but they will cover this! i have a copay that won't be cheap but i am perplexed by all of this.  my doctor thinks ivig will likely help my cranial neuropathy. after reading some of the threads on ivig, i am kind of nervous about whether it is the right choice for me.  i have profound hearing loss in one ear with vestibular damage and my worst symptoms are cranial neuropathy with all kinds of odd sensations and buzzing in my head. i have facial pain as well. i don't feel like i get sicker than most with viruses.  to those of you who know more about this, can having a chronic illness like lyme disease cause your igg and igm levels to become abnormal? or is it only autoimmune illnesses that cause this? i think lyme can cause autoimmune illness, so this is probably not a great way of wording my questions...^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
i hope that ivig helps you bb! we are both starting this around the same time so it will be good to have someone to compare notes. i will look forward to hearing about your experience.  foxy, my igg and igm were a little low in the past but are now lower than they were a few years ago (just a little lower) and that is probably why my doc thought it was the right time to try to get coverage.  it is possible that in the near future, things could change and your insurance might cover. i sure hope that will be the case for you. thanks for all of your kind support.^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
"i finally convinced my endocrinologist to give me a test for lyme. i had a negative elisa screen years ago, which i now understand isn't terribly informative. this time i got the western blot.  igm came back positive, with p23 and p41 abnormal. igg came back negative with only p41 present. this was ordered through labcorp, not igenex, so i didn't get as many bands or specifics on exactly how much of each antibody was present.  my endocrinologist admitted he didn't know much about lyme, but he consulted with someone who did, who basically told him that the results ""mean nothing."" i thought it just came back positive for igm??  this is all too odd for me too, because i've have symptoms for the past decade, but it's my understanding that igm refers to the early response. some questions:  1) i have had ebv antibodies test positive before (indicating past infection, not current). could this have caused a false positive?  2) i had food poisoning 5 days before taking the blood test. could this have caused a false positive?  3) i am completely paralyzed by trying to understand lyme on the internet, with two terribly polarized opinions on how to approach it. i understand that lyme should be a ""clinical diagnosis"" and those with symptoms might have negative labs and still should be treated. i also know i could find a llmd and start antibiotics right away with these results. i'd really like to know, however, beyond any inkling of doubt that i have lyme. what other tests would help me determine that after running the standard blot?  4) i am terrified of iv antibiotics and hearing of stories of people getting really sick and going into septic shock. are there any less invasive measures i can use to ""test the waters"" if you will, that can help treat lyme if i do in fact have it? i saw another thread on essential oil treatment, for instance. obviously alternatives might not be as effective, but i'd still like to review all of the options.  thanks for any help you can provide with this!!!!"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

breaking up mom504's post so all can read it:   daughter feeling awful for 6 months, maybe longer spurts of fatigue over past couple of years.  she's 18, made it through her senior year while visiting numerous doctors in our area trying to diagnose her with something causing her symptoms - all the typical ones with lyme.  no standard tick-borne illness tests were positive until we did the igenex which she was only cdc+ on the western blot igm, not the igg. so she can't have the lyme diagnosis.  we've done even more testing - pcr showing different tick-borne bacteria including the one for lyme. she has been diagnosed with narcolepsy (but does not have the typical genetic component).  she has started the deseret borrelia-babesia vials, takes numerous supplements and now we need to do more. she's also taking meloxicam for her pain. she basically has some autoimmune connective tissue problem (non-specified or something).  a proposed treatment follows: if we want to attack this with antibiotics, then it would be oral antibiotics initially, taking two different ones initially, everyday, along with supplements and then the protocol would be adjusted depending on her response.  the treatment with argentyn 23 (silver hydrosol) is iv and requires a picc line to be placed. the treatment is 4 days a week for one month with the dose increasing every few days.  the infusions are slow and last for up to 8 hours. the cost is about $5000/for the month of treatment, not including the supplements.  uvlrx is the ultraviolet light treatment and is twice or three times a week, and requires a peripheral iv to be started with each treatment (cannot be done through a picc line). each treatment is an hour. the treatment costs $240 per treatment and 30 treatments are recommended.  this is one of our limited local options. we're willing to go elsewhere if we know what's best.  i've heard of dr.s in california who helped someone we know. another person went to a dr. c in missouri. another went to dr. s in massachusetts and i've heard good things about a dr. l in mass., as well.  johns hopkins supposedly treats lyme/tick-borne illness, cleveland clinic supposedly the same - we've thought about getting into mayo....... any thoughts?^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

and this is my biggest fear of aggressive abx treatment. i know i have a systemic yeast problem. it is everywhere! in fact before we had thought of lyme, my naturopath was treating me for yeast. he said i was a very bad case...and it can get rough real quick. i had been on abx for aut three months due to a dental infection...and i got sick with the yeast.  many docs will think only in terms of oral or vaginal...obvious yeast signs and think the rest is a crock. but i experienced the difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue, chemical smell sensitivity etc. i was fortunate to be working with a chiro whose mom almost died of candidiasis. she had been givien two weeks and another chiro said..here is the one thing you might could do as last ditch effort. no one knew what was wrong with her. she just couldnt breathe. this man worked with her doc to get her off unnecessary meds, candida strict diet, she even showered with a special water filter. she is alive and well today. so i began to tell him the symptoms of candidiasis without even knowing it. i resisted this diagnosis for a while...but once i went on the diet, it took a couple of months and i was much better. i followed it very strictly. if i ate candy, the next day was automatic thick breathing. at that point, i would have done just about anything. regular docs make me feel crazy if i say this happened to me. he said people called his mom crazy, but her breathing was so bad she slept on the driveway. its real and i have no idea why mainstream can not understand.  now i have a maybe lyme diagnosis, positive igm, negative igg...and many of the symptoms. i am having to take abx now to just stay afloat. mainly issues with pain in my teeth, head and neck.  i have an appnt with an llmd but i just know my body can not handle the yeast so i feel like i cant win for losing.  i am going to try the probiotics lymetoo mentioned. i take a different now. i do need some options for the oral yeast. i am having major dental issues...and i am strting to wonder if it is more yeast related than bacterial, but abx makes it better.  dr. b discusses chewable acidopholus...can you get that otc?^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

please forgive me, this might be long but i feel the details are important.  a year ago, when i was 30 weeks pregnant i found a deer tick imbedded in my leg. i took it out with tweezers and send it to a lab for pcr testing directly on the tick.   i ended up getting the tick results back from the lab and the tick was positive for lyme. i did eventually get my blood tested (about 2 months exactly after getting bit). the eia test was positive indicating a past infection (igm index .7 and igg index 1.7) so it was sent to the mayo clinic for a western blot igg/igm test.  the igm came back negative (no bands indicated) the igg test was negative according to cdc standards but i tested positive for bands p18, p39 and p41-it didn't give me any of the other band results but just said positive for these three.  after doing some research it is my understanding that the mayo clinic is not the gold standard in terms of lyme testing and that there test is not very sensitive nor does it test for all the bands? i don't know (considering the bands were seen in igg) if i have a chronic/ late infection from childhood that was perhaps kicked up again because of the new tick or if it was this new tick that is causing the issues.   i'm currently having problems with my legs. i have been having tingling, burning and some numbness on one side and on the other it feels like my leg can't hold my weight anymore. it is making walking very difficult. i've also been having night sweats, headaches, inching sensations, etc.  my doctor is not a llmd and we don't really have any in this area (although i am trying to be linked with someone) through thos website seeking a doctor part.   my doctor is very focused on the cdc criteria for lyme and will not order any other blood work (through a better lab, etc). she believes that my symptoms are a slipped disk and is currently ordering an mri to check that. she doesn't believe i have lyme because of the negative western blot-regardless of the bands or the eia test. i know that band 39 is very lyme specific and worry about an infection being missed.  i had my blood taken 2 months after being infected, it may not have built up to the point of being fully detected yet. i was also pregnant at the time so my immune system was lower. i want to have my blood tested through stony brook or igenx as i know that they are the gold standard. however, they require a doctor to order the testing and since i'm in ny-this is complicated in terms of idenx.  so question: should i let this go and accept a negative as a negative??? how do i move forward when i'm being blocked in every direction.  thanks in advance for any help. love the forum : )  -------------------- seeking assistance^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"you said:  "" i did not order the screening test (because i already tested positive) or wester blot igm test as at this point i've had the infection either my whole life or greated than 7 months.""  i hope you did order the lyme western blot igm !!!! that is the one that is most often positive for a person like you who has had lyme for at least a year.  not knowing anything about lyme testing, you would not realize that lyme does not follow the normal rules of western blot igg and igm testing. read all about it here:  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=042077;p=0  ""because borrelia burgdorferi is a chronic persistent infection that may last for decades, you would think patients with chronic symptoms would have positive igg western blots.  but actually, more igm blots are positive in chronic borreliosis than igg. every time borrelia burgdorferi reproduces itself, it may stimulate the immune system to form new igm antibodies.  some patients have both igg and igm blots positive. but if either the igg or igm blot is positive, overall it is a positive result. ""  this explanation of the western blot is found at the top of medical questions under ""important info about lyme and cos.""  you really should read everything under that ""important info"" topic to get more of an education. don't spend any more money until you read more, or ask us on here before spending any significant amount of money.  it takes a lot of reading to learn all about all of this.  can you add igm testing to your current test order? i hope so!"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i do have the pdf file of dr. b and plan on reading it tonight but i'm confused about something.  everything i've read so far indicates that igm antibodies are bigger then igg antibodies and that they are present in the beginning of an infection. it is also my understanding that they peak after about a month or two after infection and start to decline. it is at this point that your igg antibodies take over and you stop producing igm antibodies and instead produce igg. so depending on when your testing depends on what you should be looking for.  because i was infected a year ago at least (perhaps even before then in childhood) why would i test for igm bands over igg? especially when both eia was low for igm and mayo with no bands indicated. my positive eia was on the igg index at 1.7 (igm was .7). so like i said, i believe i got the most bang for my buck with that test.  is my reasoning flawed??? is the answer in this question in dr. b's pdf file?  -------------------- seeking assistance^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"foxy loxy,  you got the good question!!  ------------------------- dr. rau, paracelsus switzerland says: lyme and its biological medical treatment  in the area of the rhine river (switzerland and south germany), about 1:3 of ticks are carriers of borrelia spirochetes.  when an animal or human gets bitten, the chance of developing stage 1 borreliosis is around 1:20-30.  the others who get bitten do not develop an erythema migrans or have borrelia antibody igm.  the question then arises: what happens to these others who are infected but don""t get sick or at least have antibodies?  our answer: it depends on your immune system.  ---------------------------------  brussels: the statistical math is a bit like this:  if 100 people are bitten in the area i live (same as dr. rau):  33 got contact with bb through a contaminated bite.  3 to 5 people will have an em rash or igm values or fall with flu-like illness  28-30 'infected' people will have no antibodies, no igm, no igg in their bloods.  how is that possible?  they do not even get immune values changed!!  there is no trace of contact with bb in most of them!!!   -------------------------------------- the basic question becomes then:  1) is lyme an infectious disease?  the person was healthy, and got ill because a pathogen invaded one's healthy body and made one sick.  then they should kill the pathogen and get back to a healthy state.  the pathogen will haunt the person for life, because even if one goes to remission, it will still be preying around.  the main fault is the pathogen.  the best one can reach is remission.  the only thing one can do to prevent falling ill again is to avoid a next contact with the pathogen forever!  avoid tick bites, nature, flying mosquitos, avoid eating contaminated food (all meats, all animal products), ...  ... avoid unprotected sex, avoid sleeping in beds from other people (even your own, because you already had lyme), never make a baby (because you pass it to the baby) etc   2) or is lyme an immune disease?  the person had burdens and weaknesses before the infection, and the contact with the pathogen was the tipping point to develop a clear illness.  then they should aim at re-building the body and their immune system. only then, they get back to a healthy state.  the main fault is the weak immune system, not the pathogen.  killing the pathogen is not at the core of the treatment, but the immune system is.  the aim is to get healthy again. once you feel good again, the treatment is done.  you don't need to avoid contact with the pathogen, because your body shall be able to deal with it.  so, you are healed!"^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
hi all- haven't been on in years, but you all were a lifesaver to me with my lyme disease years ago.  so i know i had tick bites again late april and found a few in me and started feeling vaguely ill so went for blood work at lab corp.  what exactly does the lyme ab/ western blot reflex lyme igg/ igm ab mean? i tested positive for that (equivocol) just over normal at 0.92. my western blot was negative.  my question is will i always test positive for this if had lyme before? is this test the elisa?  i am on doxy 200 mg day for 3 weeks and am starting to feel a little better- less headaches, less neck pain, less dizziness.  but being my first illness with lyme left me disabled for 3+ years, i am still a little paranoid..  do you think i should repeat bloodwork again in 4-6 weeks or so, or do you think it's not necessary? thanks for your help. i do not want to go running to llmd yet and spend a fortune, but also do not want to relive nightmare i went through before..

"you had an elisa test done. that is the screening test that lyme doctors consider useless since it misses so many cases of lyme disease.  you didn't write down what the lab's normal and abnormal ranges are. generally, less than .9 is negative (or normal) and 1.0 is positive.  if that is what it says on your test results, then you can see that you are very, very, very slightly over the negative score and so barely got into the ""equivocal"" range.  since is is a lousy test, i would not read anything into it. i can tell you that 6 years after i got rid of my lyme, my western blot came back positive. an elisa was not ordered.  i believe that i will likely have a positive western blot for the rest of my life.  those of us that had lyme in the past and were treated for it and cured, can likely have positive lyme antibody tests the rest of our lives.  notice i said antibody tests. the elisa and western blot are antibody tests. our bodies could continue to make and carry antibodies around in our blood forever. it is the body's ""memory"" of what occurred in the past.  so, for us, these antibody tests are useless. no sense ordering them.  if you want to order a test that actually looks to see if you have lyme in your blood or tissues, that might tell you something worthwhile, but direct tests for lyme are very expensive.  so, if i had symptoms suspicious of lyme, i would simply take a course of lyme antibiotics and see what happens.  you are doing that and feeling better, so i think that is giving you your answer.  as burrascano says, ""another very important factor [in making the lyme diagnosis] is response to treatment- presence or absence of jarisch herxheimer-like reactions, the classic four-week cycle of waxing and waning of symptoms, and improvement with therapy"" (p. 7)  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

my adult son was diagnosed with lyme disease and i was curious how you interpret the values.  what shows up as abnormal is:  lyme, western blot, serum lyme ab igg by wb: igg p66 ab. present abnormal  lyme ab igm by wb: igm p41 ab. present abnormal igm p23 ab. present abnormal  lyme igm wb interp. positive abnormal  so, just guessing, i have no idea what i'm looking at - but it looks like there is only one present igg, but 2 present igm. so he doesn't test positive for igg, but is positive for igm.  this is very confusing as when i tried to do some research it said that igm was a sign of current infection. my son does not recall a tick bite and has symptoms for at least a year if not perhaps 4 or 5 years.  my son was also tested positive for chronic reactivating epstein barr virus. the dr said that may be a false positive because of the lyme disease. interestingly, i also have caebv (but no lyme's)can it be the opposite? can the caebv cause a false positive for lyme's?^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"i'm sorry to hear that coconut cream concentrate and green tea extract did not affect your metabolism like they affected mine. for many people, coconut oil helps the thyroid. and green tea extract seems to help the immune system kill the lyme bacteria.   i know many people here will disagree with me, but i think it may be a mistake to borrow money for your llmd visit. for sure he will order more tests than just the igenex western blot...he'll want blood tests and a liver panel, and should test for other tick borne infections.  he'll recommend a number of supplements to ease the nutritional deficiencies and provide liver support. i've based much of my regimen on what llmd's have suggested to others, keeping those that helped my symptoms.  and then you'll need a followup visit for him to review the test results and suggest meds.   i had to look up mexicam. ""mexicam (meloxicam) has pharmacological actions similar to those of other nsaids. the drug exhibits antirheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity. it shows potent anti-inflammatory activity in all standard models of inflammation.""   i was having good results with a similar pain medication which was then pulled off the market due to heart attacks. this was about ten years ago.  another nsaid med ended up giving me awful stomach problems, so i had to stop that one. i finally started getting somewhere when i looked into ways to reduce inflammation and found systemic enzymes and omega 3's.   many of the llmd's are afraid to prescribe high enough doses of antibiotics due to the possiblility of being put out of business. have you read ""cure unknown"" by pamela weintraub? it explains why.   have you read any of keebler's posts about berberine? wikipedia has a good explanation of it. it kills bacteria and reduced a number of my lyme symptoms."^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
the reason i am suggesting not giving augmentin to a child < 1 year, is that there are reports of autism perhaps being  another trigger: quote following:  'augmentin courses administered under the age of one year. a proposed mechanism whereby the production of clavulanate may yield high levels of urea/ammonia in the child is presented. further an examination of this mechanism needs to be undertaken to determine if a subset of children are at risk for neurotoxicity from the use of clavulanic acid in pharmaceutical preparations.'  and if there are seizures present, that may be another thing to be very cautious about-  which was why i also mentioned haulting any further vaccines for the time being-  i worked years with my own daughter healing autism- bio- medical treatments-  i am a positive, non- confrontational person, but feel like i needed to say these things--  god bless-- your boy is still very young, and having an aware loving mother is a gift.  -------------------- lyme positive pcr blood, and positive bartonella henselae igenex, 2011. low positive fry biofilm test, 2012. update 7/16- after extensive treatments, doing okay!^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
do you know about the vets lyme forum? maybe they can shed some light on your situation with the va. have heard it is very hard to get treatment thru them. http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/militarylyme/  have you contacted support groups in your region to get doc referrals? click on support groups line in green menu box left side of this page, then go to your state and nearby states.  you are right about the igm portion of the western blot. typically this is said to reflect early disease, but actually in lyme which is relapsing, you can have a positive igm even in late stage disease. and you can test negative on all tests and still have lyme. most testing involves looking for antibodies, and chronic cases have sometimes stopped producing them. pcr is not an antibody test but is not very good either. culture test finds more positives, but not all of them, and rather expensive.  you need a doc who understands this. did you post in seeking a doctor list on this website?^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"omg, my son's very first issues, way back when he was 1 and 1/2 (he's now 3) were: sensory processing disorder and saying his knees hurt.  i thought he just had sensory issues with some autism traits. i dismissed the knee pain, because i thought ""i've never heard of a 1 and 1/2 yr old having knee pain"".  he was igenex igg positive and only had band 41 on igm.  he has lyme...and now possibly pans/pandas (i'm just learning about it).  after finding out about lyme, when he would say his knees hurt, i would feel them and sure enough, they were warm to the touch.

i would definitely have him evaluated by a lyme pediatrician. bands 39 and 83 are specific for lyme. it is my understanding from dr. harris at igenex that igg is a longer-standing infection and igm is a more recent one.  i agree with the others that his symptoms do sound suspicious. i am sure it is very difficult for a five-year-old to describe all the symptoms he has. a knowledgeable doctor would be able to help.  i am sorry your son may have lyme, but it is better to know. knowledge is power.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
hello, i'm new,i am a vet and have been going in circles with this for over fours years with them alone. and still have no answers what i have.  i could go into my symptoms with you but to make it easier, i'll just say i match everything on the lists you can possably find for lyme.  with the exception of hair falling out.i finally got the neuro to check for lyme by doing a wastern blott igg, he told me it wouldn't be nessesary for the igm part of it.  because i have had this for so long now the igm part is only for the begginning stages of lyme. i don't really agree with him on that,especially when reading about lyme.  but at least i got him to do the test, finally after four years he agreed to do it he said, just to settle my mind about it.nice of him......  i really don't trust the v.a. medical care system and not sure if they will do it in house or through a outside lab. but i have a feeling that even if it showes pos.  i wont get told about it either.or even know the reading's of it. or even if it will be done correctly. the v.a. uses alot of interns and medical students so accuracy my play a big role with the results.  i have been told i had everything from als to whippels desiese, alpha-betlical...lol...and all the tests show either neg. or not difinative / non specific enough.  so my main question is, if this test shows neg, where will that leave me now? i live in a small town in iowa, and doc's here are just not lyme litterate.  i feel i'm in the late stages of lyme and when i ask doctors around here for a referral to see a lyme specialist they tell me it's not lyme and there is no such thing as chronic lyme.  i reply to them that the mayo clinic says my condition is chronic because it has lasted for over a year and i will not get an appointment from them to be seen because it is there policy to not treat chronic patients.  so what is the medical asertation of chronic? a diesease or condition that goes untreated or undiagnossed for a period of longer than one year?  it's been over four years for me. so i guess i'm chronic...wow...blows me away....  -------------------- i love my country,but i don't have to love my gov.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

(even if only every so often)  thank you all for reading and i hope that you are doing well with your journey to beat this affliction. i do have extensive experience with lyme, so if any new members have any questions feel free to pm me."^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"laboratory tests by tom grier m.s. three main categories of lyme disease tests:  1. indirect tests (serum antibody tests):  elisa; western blot; ifa; borreliacidal antibody assay (gunderson test);t-cell activation test  2. direct detection tests:  pcr (dna amplification); lyme urine antigen test (luat); antigen capture test; culturing of skin, blood, csf, urine, or tissue; immune complex / antigen-antibody test  3. tissue biopsy and staining:  silver stain; gold stain; fluorescent tagged monoclonal antibody stains; acrodine orange; gram stain; muramidase; etc.  there is a great deal of confusion and controversy surrounding lyme disease testing. the first problem is that most of the manufacturers of these tests want you to believe that their tests are the best. at every medical convention, i listen to sales pitch after sales pitch from sales people making their product sound infallible. often the terminology is confusing and the customer frequently misinterprets what is really being said.  for example, a salesman may say the rate of false positive or false negative is less than one percent. this sounds like the test is more than 99% accurate. in reality, what it is saying is if you have 1000 test samples from the same known laboratory sample, then in less than ten samples will there be a result that differs significantly from the other 990.  in any of this, did you hear the words: ""percent reliability"" or ""percent accuracy"" in diagnosing lyme disease in humans? no! people often mistake ""false positive rate"" for accuracy. the truth is that no lyme disease test to date is close to 100% accurate, because each test has its own particular set of shortcomings. so, while the first problem with lyme disease tests is in the way they are promoted, the second problem is the way the tests are primed to recognize laboratory strains of bb, rather than wild types. third, the lyme spirochete can hide in the human body, and fool the immune system into thinking it isn't there. so, no antibodies are produced, resulting in negative tests. stealth technology isn't new, it evolved millions of years ago by the first bacteria that evaded its host's defenses.  immune responses  the first antibody our body makes in response to a foreign invader is usually immunoglobulin type m, abbreviated as igm. this large antibody takes two to four weeks to be made in quantities large enough to be consistently measured. it is at its peak of production four weeks after exposure to an antigen. the igm antibody will only stay in circulation for about six months, and then levels are usually too low to detect. if infection persists, this antibody may also persist. in general, a lyme patient who consistently has detectable igm levels is usually chronically ill, but its absence is not a reliable indicator of cure.  the second antibody we make after the igm is the igg antibody. this antibody takes four to eight weeks to form, and is gone in less than twelve months. it peaks at about six weeks. this antibody crosses the placenta, so an infected mother can pass this antibody to her child. an igg antibody titer in a newborn does not have to mean active infection. it does mean the mother has had exposure, and the child must be carefully monitored for signs of the disease.  because of the difference in the two antibodies, two separate tests are available to test for their presence. therefore, a physician must specify whether or not a patient should have an igm or igg western blot, or an igm or igg elisa test.  igm:  this is the earliest of the antibodies to appear in response to an infection. it is produced in quantity. it is six times larger than the igg antibody. because of its size, this immunoglobulin does not cross the placenta. since it cannot enter the fetus from the mother, any newborn that starts to make igm antibodies against lyme disease must be infected. however, a fetus exposed to borrelia burgdorferi early in the pregnancy may never make an antibody response to the lyme bacteria because the baby's immune system doesn't recognize it as foreign.  igg:  this antibody remains the longest and is the foot soldier of the immune system. it attacks viruses, bacteria, yeast, toxins, and transplants. the igg antibody can kill bacteria indirectly by tagging or marking the foreign invaders for destruction by the killer cells (t-cells, macrophage). or, it can kill the bacteria directly by evoking compliment, a series of enzymes and proteins that will dissolve the intruder.  note: it was once thought that plasma cells could produce antibodies that could conform to any shape necessary to attack foreign intruders. if this were true, we would have almost unlimited immunity. it is now thought that each person has a finite collection of specialized lymphocytes that are able to create a finite number of antibodies. each antibody shape is predetermined, and can be produced by only one type of lymphocyte. when the body is invaded by a foreign antigen, it will stimulate one of these cells, and only that cell will begin to clone itself. this process takes several weeks. if we lack the right cell type to do the job, we are left with a gap in our immunity. this might account for why some lyme patients with certain tissue types have greater morbidity, while others have relatively mild symptoms.  dr. alan steere, m.d., observed that lyme arthritis patients with tissue type hla-dr2 and hla-dr4 had more severe arthritis and chronic disease. other tissue types have been associated with an increased incidence of multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases. it might be that different patient tissue types might account for a difference in patient's symptoms to a greater degree than different strains of the bacteria.  it is known that this bacteria has an affinity for specific tissues. if you have a specific lack of immunity, this may cause the disease to manifest differently in those tissues. for example, let's say hypothetically that your heart is infected with borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. perhaps most people make an antibody that suppresses attachment of bb to certain fibers in the heart. if you lack that antibody, the infection may continue more aggressively and manifest differently - for instance, causing an enlargement of the muscle fibers or destruction of the conduction pathways.  instead of lacking a specific antibody, perhaps some individuals make a different kind of antibody, an antibody that not only attacks the bacteria - but may attack the heart as well! it is well known and documented that some patients produce auto-antibodies, which are antibodies that our own body produces that attack our own tissues. this is the basis of autoimmune disease. in some lyme disease patients, an auto-antibody against cardiolipin has been clearly established in lyme patients with lyme carditis.  perhaps, in addition to other lyme tests, we should also be tissue typing patients and searching for auto-antibodies? tissue typing requires a small blood sample, and costs about $200.  western blot  the western blot essentially makes a map of the different antibodies the immune system produces to the bacteria. the map separates the antibodies by the weight of their respective antigens and are reported in units called kilo daltons or kda. for example, a western blot may report bands at 22, 23, 25, 31, 34, 39, and 41 kda. each of these bands represents an antibody response to a specific protein found on the spirochete. the 41 band indicates an antibody to the flagella 41 kda protein and is nonspecific. the 31 kda band represents the ospa protein and is specific for just a few species of borrelia, as is the 34 band ospb, and 23 kda ospc.  in 1994, the association of state and territorial public health laboratory directors, under a cdc grant, decided that there should be consistency between labs reporting lyme disease western blots, and that a specific reporting criteria should be established. the consensus committe, chaired by dr. michael osterholm, ph.d., mn, set nationwide standards for western blot reporting. this sounds good, but one could argue they made a bad situation worse. prior to the hearing, virtually every lab had accepted bands 22, 23, 25, 31, and 34 kda as specific and significant, and reported them as positive for exposure to borrelia burgdorferi. not only are these bands specific for borrelia species, but they represent all of the major outer surface proteins being used to develop the lyme vaccines. the committee, without any clear reasoning, disqualified those bands as even being reportable.  after the consensus meeting, those bands were no longer acceptable. the result was that what had been a fair-to-good test for detecting lyme disease had now become poor, arguably useless. many scientists have questioned these new reporting criteria, and several wrote letters of protest to both the committee and to laboratory journals. many labs stopped reporting the actual bands and instead, simply reported the test as positive or negative, thus preventing any further interpretations. (90)  how badly did the lab directors bootstrap this test? the following is an analysis of the new guidelines presented as an abstract and lecture at the 1995 rheumatology conference in texas, chaired by dr. alan steere, md. (1995 rheumatology symposia abstract """"1254, dr. paul fawcett, et al.)  this was a study designed to test the recently proposed changes to western blot interpretation by the second national conference on serological testing for lyme disease, sponsored by the cdc. the committee proposed limiting the bands that could be reported in a western blot for diagnosis of lyme disease. out of a possible 25 bands, 10 specific bands were selected as being reportable. an lgg western blot must have five or more of these bands: 18, 21,28, 30, 39, 41,,45, 58, 66 and 93 kda. an lgm western blot must have two or more of the following three bands: 23, 39, 41.  conspicuously absent are the most important bands, 22, 23, 25, 31, and 34, which include ospa, osp-b and osp-c antigens - the three most widely accepted and recognized bb antigens. these antigens were the antigens chosen for human vaccine trials. this abstract showed that, under the old criteria, all of 66 pediatric patients with a history of a tick bite and bull's-eye rash who were symptomatic were accepted as positive under the old western blot interpretation.  under the newly proposed criteria, only 20 were now considered positive. (the number of false positives under both criteria was zero percent.) that means 46 children who were all symptomatic would probably be denied treatment! that's a success rate of only 31%.  *note: a misconception about western blots is that they have as many false positives as false negatives. this is not true. false positives based on species specific bands are rare.  the conclusion of the researchers was: ""the proposed western blot reporting criteria are grossly inadequate, because it excluded 69% of the infected children.""  elisa test  the enzyme-linked immunosorbant serum assay is the simplest, least expensive, easiest to perform, and most common lyme test ordered. it is a test based on detecting the antibodies that our bodies make in response to being exposed to borrelia burgdorferi (bb). it is a preferred test by laboratories, not because it is more accurate than other lyme tests, but because it is automated. many different patient samples can be performed by a single machine simultaneously. this allows for a faster turnover, less costs, and theoretically, standardized test results that are consistent from lab to lab.  we are told by manufacturers, health departments and clinics that the lyme elisa tests are good, useful tests, but in two blinded studies that tested laboratories for accuracy, they failed miserably. lorie bakken, ms/mph, showed in her studies that there was not only inaccuracy and inconsistency between competing laboratories, but also between identical triple samples sent to the same lab. in other words, identical samples often resulted in different results! in the first study, forty-five labs correctly identified the samples only 55% of the time.  in the latest study by the college of american pathologists, 516 labs were tested. the overall result was terrible! there were almost equal numbers of false positives as false negatives. overall, the labs were 55% inaccurate. the labs could only give a correct result 45% of the time. you are actually better off to flip a coin!  the basis of the elisa test is that it can be primed to be very specific for particular antibodies. this is done by taking a laboratory sample of the lyme bacteria and breaking the sample down into fragments. these fragments, or antigens, are then embedded on the side of a reagent vessel like a test tube. then the patient's serum is added, and any free (non-complexed) antibodies specific for the test strain will then bind to the antigens, which are linked to special enzymes that will change color when antibodies are present. the sample is continually diluted until the reaction no longer occurs and no color change can be detected. the sample is then reported as a dilution ratio, such as one part serum to 256 parts water, or 1:256.  the elisa test sounds simple and straight forward, but it has a couple of major flaws. borrelia species are some of the most polymorphic bacteria known to exist. in other words, most borrelia species can significantly change its surface proteins enough during cell division as to evade our immune system, and may differ from laboratory strains enough to result in negative tests, even if antibb antibodies are present! in europe, this problem is intensified because they have recognized three species of borrelia that cause lyme disease, and so they have available three separate elisa tests. the questions in america are: 1) have we recognized all the strains and species of borrelia that cause lyme disease symptoms, and 2) are we incorporating them into our tests? the answer is no. convenience and expedience has chosen that we don't prime our elisa tests withwild strains, but use a laboratory strain.  when a lab reports that their elisa test has had high specificity and high sensitivity, it is usually interpreted by doctors as being a more accurate test, but the doctors don't know what the lab is actually measuring. one of the hidden problems of serologic lyme tests is the fact that the tests must be primed with a source of bacteria to create the reactions with the patient's antibodies. to do this, virtually all labs rely on a laboratory strain of bb known as strain b-31.taking purified antigens from strain b-31 and injecting them into mice, they then can extract a monoclonal antibody to each antigen, or a polyvalent antibody soup. this antibody is concentrated and purified, and then added to the elisa test to test the efficacy and performance of the test. unlike the wild strains, b-31 grows well in culture, and this makes it a perfect choice as a consistent and inexpensive source of bb. but the affinity the mouse monoclonal antibody has to b-31 antigen is quite different from the affinity the patients' antibodies have to the same antigen. this means the test may register as negative because the test cannot detect the slightly different antibody profile that a wild strain of bb can produce. in other words, the labs are really comparing apples to oranges! this is why, when the american college of pathologists used human sera to test the accuracy of 516 different laboratories elisa tests nation wide, the overall accuracy was only 45%.  in the quest for specificity, most elisa tests have become so specific that the test may fail to detect antibodies from related strains of borrelia. this would include different genospecies that cause lyme disease, as well as different borrelia species that cause tickborne relapsing fever. would a cross reaction to the borrelia species that cause tick-borne relapsing fever be so bad?  the real achilles' heal of an elisa test is that it can only detect free antibody. it cannot detect any antibody that has become complexed with antigen.  the elisa test depends on the active, free antibodies to attach to the free antigens that have been embedded on the walls of the test tube. if the antibodies in the serum being tested are already attached to antigens, then the enzyme reaction cannot take place. if we think of antibodies as sort of keys that fit into locks, and that on the surface of the bacteria are specific locks we now call antigens, you can see that once a key is inserted into a lock, the key is no longer available to open any other locks.  what makes this test so misleading is that many doctors accept high readings as an indication that the patient must really be sick. this logic is exactly backwards. if a patient is really infected with lots of bacteria, that means they have a lot of bacterial antigens floating around in the blood that are complexing free antibodies. so, as free antigen increases, free antibody decreases. since the elisa test detects only free antibody, a negative test might actually indicate a more serious infection. many times, i have seen totally asymptotic patients with elisa titers over 1000 be treated as though they were on death's doorstep simply because they had a high titer, while patients with borderline titers who are practically disabled are ignored, because a low titer is perceived as meaning less infected! these conclusions are erroneous and actually opposite to the truth, which is that a high titer means greater natural immunity.  this phenomena can actually be observed by using vaccines. if a patient has been vaccinated for a disease like tetanus, they will carry a high titer of free antibodies. if you try to measure those antibodies an hour after a booster shot is given, they will test negative. this is because the injected tetanus antigen complexes all available free antibody before the body can make more, so the measurable free antibody level drops.  the nature of all antibody is to seek out the proper antigen. the level of free antibody available is variable and often inadequate for the amount of antigen available. as antigen increases (i.e. the bacteria are dividing faster than the immune system can handle), free antibody drops.  what a high elisa test may be a better indicator of is what level of immunity is the patient capable of mounting against this infection? a high titer is the same thing as saying the patient has a high natural immunity, and a low can mean that the patient may be overwhelmed by infection.  in one year-long study by dr. sam donta, md, done on chronic lyme patients, the initial elisa tests proved to be more than 66+% inaccurate (1996 ldf conference lecture). other researchers have also found the elisa tests to be inaccurate. using a 45-panel diagnostic testing protocol from the nih for testing the efficacy of the elisa and western blot, researchers found the accuracy of the lyme elisa varied from about 5075%, and were routinely inconsistent. the cdc's elisa test did no better on average than any other elisa. it is the cdc elisa test which is used for surveillance of emerging lyme disease in the united states, yet the test was correct only about two out every three tests. too often, a single negative elisa test can prevent a sick patient from getting treatment, even despite having serious symptoms!  in my opinion, the elisa test is worthless as a diagnostic tool in lyme disease. it is inconsistent and inaccurate, and should be discontinued as a tool to diagnose lyme. if the nih and cdc truly believe, as they've stated, that the diagnosis of lyme disease is to be made on the basis of symptoms, then these tests should be temporarily banned until each manufacturer can prove efficacy using human serum.  -------------------- do unto others as you would have them do unto you. remember iam not a doctor just someone struggling like you with tick borne diseases.  newbie links"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
wow, i am surprised at some of these responses. you need to go to the lyme doc period, your health is your wealth.  ultimately if you learn everything you can, not leave any stone unturned you can have your life back. that's if you are even a hard case, you don't even know that yet.  it's certainly not easy or quick for a lot of us here. i have treated for over 2 1/2 years. i have learned enough that i could treat myself if need be. you need to empower yourself with the knowledge that you need to navigate through this illness where we have virtually no support.  these are some of the things i have done, i tested positive for lyme, bartonella, and babesia.  1) you must find out from the get go if you cannot detox lyme, mold or both the test is hla dr. i wish i had. i am in that boat and you must have cholesrymine on board if that's the case.  2) i did lots of antibiotics some times up to 5 at a time (insurance covers these)  3) exercise, no sugar, no gluten, and probiotics.  4) remediate for mold if you can't detox it.  take care- you can get better!^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"carolann, the term ""coinfection"" is used to describe certain infections that quite often travel with lyme disease. so, if you get lyme, you have a very good chance of getting one or more of these particular infections simultaneously.  the most common coinfections are babesiosis, bartonella, and ehrlichiosis.  these are infections that regular doctors don't know anything about. but, lyme doctors know the symptoms of each of them and will be able to tell by your symptoms alone if you seem to have them. there are also blood tests that can sometimes tell you that you have them. the igenex blood tests are the best for finding coinfections, but none are perfect (meaning, none are 100% accurate), so lyme doctors go by symptoms a lot to diagnose the coinfections.  the reason coinfections are important is because you can't get rid of lyme unless you also treat and get rid of every coinfection the person has. these diseases all help one another remain in the body.  so, a lyme specialist is who you need to have the best chance of getting well. each of these coinfections requires a different medication to cure.  this is why one famous lyme doctor says a lyme patient is like a person who has 13 nails in their foot. he means that not only do they have lyme, they also have a number of coinfections, plus viruses, plus parasites, etc. all because the lyme weakens the person's immune system and that allows all types of illnesses to take over.  the person will not feel better until all 13 nails (diseases, viruses, etc.) are removed.  so, lyme is actually a number of diseases. probably at least 66% of those with lyme disease test positive (thru igenex) for babesiosis. this is based on the burrascano lyme treatment guidelines.  i had lyme, babesiosis, and bartonella. everyone in my area with lyme has all 3.  if you want to look at a short list of symptoms for the most common coinfections, look at pages 26-27 of the burrascano guidelines found here:  http://www.ilads.org/lyme_disease/b_guidelines_12_17_08.pdf"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"the numbers are bands. you have listed the bands that were + (positive) and the bands that were ind.  a + means that your body made antibodies to that band. in order to make antibodies, something was in your body that your body reacted to. more than one + means a lot more antibodies to that band.  ind means ""indeterminate."" that means, your result for that band was not negative, but there was some reaction (some small amount of antibodies) but not enough to reach the + level. so, we call that a weak positive on that band.  here is a quote from the burrascano guidelines. it tells you what the western blot will look like if you have lyme:  ""western blots are reported by showing which bands are reactive. 41kd bands appear the earliest but can cross react with other spirochetes.  the 18kd, 23-25kd (osp c), 31kd (osp a), 34kd (osp b), 37kd, 39kd, 83kd and the 93kd bands are the species-specific ones, but appear later or may not appear at all. you should see at least the 41kd and one of the specific bands."" (p.7)  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  so, you reacted to bands 31, 34, 39, 41, and 83-93. burrascano says that if you react to band 41 (you did) and at least one other of the lyme-specific bands named, you have lyme. you reacted to 4 lyme-specific bands in addition to band 41.  here is a quote from a different lyme doctor, dr. c in missouri. it says the same thing:  ""in my clinical experience, if a patient has symptoms suspicious for borreliosis, and has one or more of the following bands, there is a very high probability the patient has borreliosis.  these bands are 18, 22, 23-25, 28, 30, 31, 34, 37, 39, 41, 83, and 93.  [---- from dr c's update from 2005 --- ----the significant antibodies, in my opinion, are the 18, 23-25, 28, 30, 31, 34, 39, 58, 66 and 93.----]  this is true regardless of whether it is igg or igm.. ""  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=042077;p=0  you may want to read the entire explanation of the western blot at the link above. dr. c is very good at explaining this test.  hopefully, this will give you confidence that you do in fact have lyme disease.  to prepare for your first lyme doctor appointment, look at the list of lyme symptoms on pages 9-10 of burrascano. make a list of every one you have.  this will help the lyme doctor immensely. if you want to find out how burrascano says that lyme should be diagnosed, read page 7.  here he says that the tests are not reliable, so you base the diagnosis on symptoms, medical history, ruling out other causes, and lyme tests.  then, after all of that, to prove the diagnosis, give the patient a trial course of lyme treatment (antibiotics) and see what happens.  that is how lyme has to be diagnosed even in 2016 because we still do not have very good tests. they miss so many cases of lyme.  if you have a positive lyme tests, great, but for the large number of folks who don't, this tells doctors how to determine if the person has lyme.  most medical folks would call your lyme test a weak positive. but, a lyme specialist would say that your body is reacting to all of the right bands on the western blot, so it is lyme.  there is no other way to get the test results that you got. positive and weak positive test results can be relied upon. it is the negative test results that cannot be trusted.  so, you are fortunate to get the results you got. a lyme specialist will treat you for lyme.  i had undiagnosed lyme disease (plus babesiosis and bartonella) for at least 10 years before a doctor thought to test me for lyme. still, i got well. i got rid of my diseases when i finally went to a lyme doctor who followed the burrascano guidelines.  then, i sent 5 of my friends to docs who followed burrascano, and they also got well. that is why i believe in the burrascano method of treating lyme disease.  it is now over 11 years since i was cured and i am still symptom-free and enjoying my life. i stick around here just to point folks to the good doctors.  i wasted 2 years with 2 other lyme doctors who did not know enough to cure me. so, do a lot of research and find the lyme specialist who is getting people well. these are few and far between.  many doctors treat lyme disease, but very few have ever cured anyone of the disease. that takes a lot more expertise.  so, contact lyme support groups (see support groups in the left side of the page) and get input from folks on this site and other lyme sites. talk to as many lyme patients as possible before choosing your lyme doctor.  study the burrascano guidelines also. they tell you what good lyme treatment looks like. evaluate your lyme treatment against these guidelines.  welcome to lymenet! we will help you here all we can.  .............................................

hello, i am new to this site and have never used a forum before so i don't know if i'm doing this correctly, but i need some help.  i have had so many health problems for the past 5 years and am at a loss. first, it was acid reflux, candida, extreme foot pain, knee pain, rashes, ringing in ears, headaches, weird electric zap feelings that cause insomnia,  feeling tired all the time, hypothyroid, ovarian cysts, irregular menstrual bleeding, extreme right side rib pain that wraps around to my back and has been there for over 2 months now.  i've been to physical therapists, massage therapists, chiropractor...etc. and nothing helps this pain. i am also suffering from extreme panic attacks and depression. i am scared.  i started seeing a natural doctor who has tested me for everything. she took 18 vials of blood! she tested for autoimmune everything and i didn't have anything, but had a dormant ebv.  i mentioned that i have had over 10 ticks in me in my lifetime and she tested me for lyme through igenex. here are my results:  igenex igm result: ind cdc: neg  31 + 34 ind 41 + 83-93 ind  igenex igg result: neg cdc: neg  34 ind 39 ind 41 ++  the doctor said she thinks it's postiive, but doesn't know and wants me to see a llmd. i have an appointment with one, but not for a while and i'm going insane trying to understand my results.  please help me! what do you think of these results? i don't know where else to turn and need some help/support so i came here.  i know if i have lyme, it would've been for about 5 years now, i think. it would explain everything that i've been going through and make so much sense, but the test doesn't seem to think that. please help and thank you so much!  ..............................................

hi, i don't mean to hijack someone else's post, but i have questions about the western blot test and i can't figure out how to post a new question.  is it possible to have a false positive? can someone tell me is my test indeed positive? my dr said it is, but i don't have nearly as many positive numbers as what i see some people do. my numbers are as follows:  lyme ab igg - 58 & 41 abnormal lyme ab igm - 41 & 23 abnormal  i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease earlier this year and have dealt with different health issues over that past 5-7 years. just seeking answers and thankful to have found a group who understands lyme! thank you in advance for your answers.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
any insight would be helpful on my test results. i'm on my third doctor, my last one telling me i didn't have lyme. (negative elisa test.) went to an llmd. still waiting on lots more test results, but i got my igenex back and am looking for any help on interpretation?  my positive marked items: igm: **31 kda. ++ **34 kda. + **39 kda. ind **41 kda. + 58 kda. ++  igg: **23-25 kda + **31 kda ++++ **34 kda + ** 39 kda ind **41 +   all others are negative.  is this a positive, negative, or undecided test result? what to the *** and ++ mean?   any of your thoughts or opinions are appreciated. i understand my llmd will go over things with me at my next appointment and address my results with my other tests, but i'd like to go in informed and ready with further questions.   thank you for your help and support!^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
just wondered if pcr test are reliable at all. i have been igenex cdc igm positive years ago, but one of my doctors suggested the pcr test to see if i still have active lyme. thanks for any help.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i had the western blot test done and have a couple questions.  is it possible to have a false positive? can someone tell me is my test indeed positive? my dr said it is, but i don't have nearly as many positive numbers as what i see some people do. my numbers are as follows:  lyme ab igg - 58 & 41 abnormal lyme ab igm - 41 & 23 abnormal  i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease earlier this year and have dealt with different health issues over that past 5-7 years. just seeking answers and thankful to have found a group who understands lyme! thank you in advance for your answers.

in the morning, right after i wake up while still lying in bed, i briefly and suddenly get very hot, have brief, light sweating, then this resolves.  this has happened every morning for years, despite bio-identical hormone replacement (happened whether i was taking it or not).  i had air hunger which completely resolved once i started sustained-release t3.  babesia and co-infection testing through igenex all negatve.  lyme igm western blot positive.  anyone else have hot flash/brief sweating first thing in the morning? with just lyme?^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"breaking up the above post so all can read it:   hello, a few years ago i was tested positive igm via wb and treated with combo of abx and herbs for about 7 months total (with a few breaks in between).  most symptoms got way better, and i stopped treatment sooner than recommended because i felt so good. severe panic, anxiety, and vision disturbances were main symptoms.  now, 3 years later the anxiety has come back with a venegence. i get so dizzy and faint feeling that i am scared to drive and need help watching my kids. i am taking 25mg zoloft, a supplement that has l-theanine, magnesium, gaba, and taurine. i also take phosphatidylserine per my doctor's suggestion.  i feel a bit better, but have many panic attacks anytime i need to drive or commit to a stressful task. (multiple a week).  i have recently taken new blood tests and i had a positive babesia, as well as a positive wb (but less strong than the first test, it was igg this time).  so, in summary, how do i know if this panic attacks are lyme symptoms coming back, or babesia that was never treated, or just plain ""unrelated"" anxiety?  my doctor seems to think this is bartonella (which it may be since my 5 year old has a positive bart test), but i have never had positive bart.  i want to be thoughtful about treating the most likely candidate since i only really have anxiety symptoms (and get extremely tired middle of the day and need to suddenly lay down--but also have thyroid issues so not sure its related).  can anyone tell me the most likely candidate for this anxiety symptom? i get anxious with antibiotics, so i will need to go the herbal route but want to target the most likely cause. sorry for long winded question!"^0^1^1^1^0^^0^0^0^0^0
since my initial results were borderline, both igenx (through my nd) and a llnd said the way to tell if i had lyme was a retest after a month of doxy.  so....here's my first test  igm 23-25 ind 31 ind 34 + 41 +  igg  39 ind 41 ++  and now the retest  igm  31 ind 34 ind 41 + 66 +  igm  31 ind 39 ind 41 ++  so the results did change, but also fell out of the igenx positive range. should i take this to mean that since they changed, i likely have lyme and need to pursue a llmd (which will not be an easy task given my location and health, so i don't really want to go for no reason), or does it mean it really isn't lyme?  thanks!^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
hi all! thanks for reading...will try to keep it short. been terribly sick since 1994, dx with cfs, fibro, and about 20 other diseases. have never had a remission and symptoms just keep cycling from one system to the next and a whole party is had. tested high positive for lyme in 1996 western blot...did a month of iv antibiotics and that was that. been testing on quest labs just positive for band 43 igg and igm until now.  symptoms have gotten as severe as they ever were in the 90's and we tested again for lyme thru quest. bands 23 and 41 both igg and igm positive as well as a positive lyme igm, but negative lyme igg. even the mayo clinic agreed that i did have lyme in the 1990's and it took them 2 days to decide whether or not i still had it back in 2000.  i have multi systemic problems from my brain to toes, disabling and unbearable most days. from what i read, band 23 is lyme specific? is it time for me to take the leap and finally see an llmd for further igenix testing? i can't go on suffering like this. also, i'm in ny...who should i see? after all these years, i need a great dr, although i''ll have to find money somewhere. thanks so much for any info/guidance you may have!!

"what is the purpose of the knee aspiration? to drain fluid? is there risk involved if you don't?  i'm knowledgeable on some things, but not knee aspirations.  you've found a good place for support. there are many kind people on here.  i'm not the best at taking my own advice, but i can tell you i've totally freaked out over many misdiagnoses over the years. like i said, both test for ""ra"" came back highly positive.  my llmd said it's lyme arthritis. plus, the pain was in by big joints, not my small joints. ra is usually found first in small joints. one of the physicians who diagnosed me with ra said he was sure i didn't have lyme.  after further questioning when i said i have two out of 3 igm positives, so how can you rule out lyme, he said, well i dunno much about lyme. see an id doctor.  doctors diagnose what hey know. so rheumatologist will almost always diagnose autoimmune diseases. gastroenterologists will diagnose tummy, bowel probs etc with a gastro diagnoses. your llmd will help look at the bigger picture.  i've found when i look on the internet i have symptoms of tons of diagnoses. do i have those diseases? nope, just lyme and cos and some other stuff  hang in there.  -------------------- just sharing my experiences, opinions, and what i've read and learned. not medical advice."^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i had a c4a in the 15,000's range before i started treatment for lyme.  my doctor stated that, to him, this meant unequivocally that i had lyme--  he told me he did not even need a lyme titer result to start treatment in my case.  i did not believe this, and had my lyme titer done through igenex.  to my surprise, the igm was positive.  a few months after treatment, i am dramatically better (not completely well), and my level has decreased to 4000's.  i remember reading an article that stated one cannot use the c4a test to follow lyme treatment, but my numbers did decline with antibiotic treatment.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i didn't read all posts above.  i got rid of chronic lyme with multiple re-infections in between.  food-wise, what helped me most was an allergy free diet. i felt that cutting allergens was a key to help healing my body.  i tested energetically all foods that caused me harm (allergy, reactions).   ----------------------- if i had to re-do it all again, i would have also stopped gluten.  i don't have lyme anymore, but i do feel so much more energetic after stopping gluten.  gluten is way too hard to digest, and has no nutritional function. it just makes things hard for your body.  the amount of gluten in wheat is huge. about 1/3 of the bread, pasta, pizza is simply: glue! gluten!  only when you stop it for a couple of months you may feel the difference: but it's clear.  my daughter stopped catching colds and viruses at school from the moment she stopped gluten.  i had zero idea that gluten was directly involved in messing her immune system. since june last year, she is cold free (before, she stayed home almost once a week, if not more, due to some infectious bug). -----------------------   candida does not bulge with strict diet, in my opinion.  it will get worse if you exaggerate on sugar /carb / fruits, for sure. but cutting these, is zero warranty of cure or even improvement (in my experience).  just diminish the amount of sugar /gluten, if you can.  i always ate cow milk products, but now i am only consuming goat and sheep products (except for butter).  i don't think to stop all yeast will do any good (in my opinion). we need yeast/ candida to survive, so why cutting it off?  all fresh fruits and veggies are covered with candida. many are beneficial.   beer is known to have many healing properties (see buhner). maybe some people react badly to it? i never did any yeast-free diet.  in fact, i'm fermenting things home and forcing myself to eat these live foods to cure my candida.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
bcb1200 and jamers :i have almost all the symtoms above.in the past treatment with artemisin helped but they came back with full vengence and almost killed me 3 times.i know that when tried malarone and mepron helped but none of the doctors gave me the correct dose.was too small and it comes back.  also after i had the car aksident it came back fully force and in hospital they told me i was negative for it but while in vancomycin and other drugs i was sweating and changing the clothes in the morning and gasping for air while wbc and rbc went down hill and ended up with blood transfusion and they kicked me out of the hospital praying for me as they could not figure it out what it was.all the labs were negative ( somthing i knew as i never got pozitive on anything but igenex and muscle testing and qxci showed malaria besides lyme and i test highly pozitive in muscle testing for artemisin ).  back to malarone and artemisin it calmed it down but the first days the vomiting and the pressure in the head caused surreal pain in the head and gut /liver.  wish i had done igenex babesia fish but my husband tested negative while he is shaking same as me but no head presure yet while my son got pozitive on microti and was treated but still has some twitches on and off.  the twitches were for me from head to toe and never left still are a few here and there .have treated bart for 2 1/2 years and am disable now .  i know i had bart before but the symtoms above all of them it belong to babs ( i was choking , gasping for air since 9 years ago )before it i had just anxiety ( bartonella ) and my cd57 has been 115 high in the begining and 2 years after.  it is babs ( i gained weight and than 2 years ago and 1 year ago while after the car accident was activated in 48 hrs , run high fever for 1 month ended up switching 2 hospitals , could not walk and have a shower but almost in wheel chair , tremor and sweats and vomiting non stop preassure in the head , heart issues , blood clott in the left hand and they stoped me taking artemisin that is when rbc went down the hill in two weeks and thank good from the blood transfusion the numbers went up and i was left to get out of the hospital.  could not move for 3 months from the bed and was taking low dosages of artemisin and finally could get to a llmd that saw the eusinophils high ( llmd top ) and gave me mepron.  could not continue treatment due to funds and vomiting.quit fighting but survived and gained 60 pounds while left mepron after 3 months of taking it .the top llmd ( was far and exspensive) while my body was quiting and i quit too. now somehow my body survived and i am still in artemisin finally raised it to 6 pills a day and feel a little human .could not write in the forum.  i have had it for many years ( had deleted my previous identity due to suspicious from my insurance) and fighting with the ducs in the hopsitals that is babesiosis and they told me that they treat it with blood transfusion ( well for the moment kept me alive) .  can not say my previous name as i have been here before for 4 years .  i was diagnosed clinicly with eusinophilis high since 14 years ago in europe end that is where i started being fatigue and headache while the docs called it migrane startedon the left side and spread everywhere in the head and torso .have down everything under the son all hulda clarcks steps years ago , cofe enema , bionic ( by the way exsploded the babesia /protozoa due to ozone that i have had treated previously but killed lyme as i was the only petient that killed borrelia garini and cried in pain for 5 hrs due to the treatment that killed the lyme in my head ) .have used saunas etc.  anyway all i am explaining is ( bionic works for lyme ) carefull with ozone as it boost babesia even though was a great killer of a virus for the moment that could have been as well as meningitis , or do the treatment for lyme in germany and start right away artemisin and mepron malarore.  i was in artemisin for 2 1/2 years.the first improvement from babesia was the highest dosages that hulda clarck offers in step 2 and tre for the parasites , but carefull i would not recomend it as i did not knew i had babesia and i created blood clots and was horrible but it saved my life until 1 year after i found out i had lyme fully blown lyme .igenex pozitive highly neuro all bands.  the neuropsykiotrist in hospital told me i am an exspense to my family!can you beilive it , while i was insisting that i have babesia and a rash showed in my right leg a rash that i have had clearly 6 years ago but was clueless of lyme.  so due to being tired /exzosted and exspenses i never got all the treatment of babesia and i have been diagnosed from the top llmd for it.  do not ignore any of this symtoms above they scream babesia and check eusinophils or rbc if they are low as mine were after the car accident(babesia exsploded thanks good i have had treated lyme in germany with bionic before the car accident).^0^1^1^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

hi i am new here so please bear with me. i am a 48 year old female...i do not ever recall being bit by a tick except back in 1980's i had a tick stuck on my neck for a week..i never had a bullseye and back then i don't even think they tested for lyme...anyway fast forward i have always had issues with fatigue on and off and several years ago i had some issue with muscle spasms..went away. 2 years ago i was seeing a nurse practitioner for a chronic uti ..she also specializes in interstitial cystitis and lyme....she did an ispot lyme test and here were my results...  ispot lymetm interpretation guide positive: ifn-? secretion (lyme antigens)  result indicates significant t cell ifn-? secretion upon stimulation by lyme-specific antigens. this suggests past or current borrelia burgdorferi infection. potential reasons for a positive response: � patient has active infection that may be acute or chronic. � patient had a b. burgdorferi infection that is no longer active but host memory t cell response to lyme antigens persists. ispottm parameter ifn-gamma secretion (dbpa, ospc, p100, vlse-1) (lyme) ldt whole blood ifn- ? secretion (unstimulated) whole blood   result positive (26 sfu) normal sfu 3 optimal >400sfu  reference range negative negative: <=17 equivocal: 18-24 positive: >=25 normal: <=10 optimal: >=400 ifn- ? secretion (phytohemagglutinin) whole blood limitations l dt  i am not sure what this means...but she had said i was positive for lyme....i wasn't so concerned with it at the time b/c the bigger issue was the recurrent uti...now that i have that in check i think i may be having some lyme issues...  recently i went to mexico with my family and the last 2 days our party of 4 got sick ,....we did not have ice or drink the water...one person was extremely sick for 2 weeks with fever and diareah their stool actually tested positive for a common food poisoning bacteria...my stool sample was negative...and i really only had some acid reflux and nausea...i think because i take a really good probiotic everyday this helped me. anyway...i decided to do a all natural parasite detox.from dr. omar armin..... its a 90 day protocol i only bought the 30 days and after a week in i started experiencing muscle twitching /spasms mostly in the arms and legs...but my left upper eye lid is also twitching on and off .... at first i thought it might be a symptom from the herbs..but they are very low doses ...i do take magnesium regularly and did even before this...so i know its not that..and i drink over 34 oz of water a day (because of my bladder). so i am not dehydrated. i notice the twitching is worse when i am at rest.  so what i am hoping you all can help me with is :  1. what should i make of those test results...is my level really high b/c i think it looks low...but am i reading that correctly?  2. is it possible that the herbs are hitting the lyme and that is why i am experiencing this twitching/spasms?  any other information or advise you can offer i welcome.  here is info to the detox and ingredients of the herbs incase you need to see them:its 3 bottles freedome bottle 2 pills each morning : garlic, olive leaf extract, citrus seed extract, goldenseal, aloe vera, pomegranate, oregano leaf, clove bud, black walnut hull, peppermint leaf, black cumin seed, watermelon seed, gentian root, wormwood bark, hyssop leaf, cramp bark, thyme leaf, fennel seed, pumpkin seed, caprylic acid, rosemary, papaya, rangoon creeper  cleanse bottle 2 pills each afternoon : psyllium seed husk, atlantic kelp, corn silk, fo-ti, chinese rhubarb root, peppermint leaf, black cumin seed, cinnamon bark, fennel seed, ginger root, orange peel extract, clove bulb, cascara sagrada, slippery elm bark.  restore bottle 2 pills each night : molasses, carob, chinese rhubarb root, sage, thyme leaf, ginger root, clove bulb, cayenne fruit, rosemary leaf, alfalfa leaf, licorice root, chamomile, grapefruit seed extract, echinacea, atlantic kelp, chicory, corn silk, fennel seed, peppermint leaf, safflower.^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"well, what do you want to test for?  do you know that you still have lyme, babs, and bart? or do you want to try to find out if you still have them?  if you want to find out if you still have lyme, you have to use a test that looks directly for the lyme bacteria like the advanced laboratory services lyme culture test. or, you could do a urine antigen capture test.  however, rather than spend hundreds of dollars on the advanced lab lyme culture test, i would just go by symptoms to figure out if it was gone.  generally, until you get rid of babesiosis, you cannot get rid of lyme. the coinfections all help the lyme to remain in your body, so you can't get rid of lyme without treating all coinfections that you have.  do you want to test for other types of babs like duncani?  do you suspect another disease like rocky mountain spotted fever or ehrlichia, epstein barr virus, etc.?  really, i don't know what your lyme doctor is trying to accomplish with this testing. i don't know what igenex test he would do on you and for what purpose.  i would not spend money on further testing without him clearly telling you the purpose of the testing. you have to understand that antibody tests just tell you that you were exposed to that disease at one time. so, there is no sense getting a western blot from igenex or any other antibody tests like babs igg and igm, etc.  ask your doc why he ordered antibody tests since he knows that you had or have lyme and babs already. right now, it seems like your doc doesn't know what he is doing.  see this statement from a conventional lab regarding the western blot antibody test:  ""once someone has had lyme disease, the person will typically have detectable amounts of borrelia igg antibodies in their blood for the rest of their life.""  https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/lyme/tab/test/  this website gives the conventional wisdom on lyme testing, which makes it hard for a person to get a positive lyme test. so ignore what it says in that regard.  focus on what it is telling you about how long you will have lyme antibodies show up in the western blot.  i hope you can see why i don't understand what your doctor was doing when he ordered these tests. it makes no sense."^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"a completely new approach to lyme disease   we see so many lyme disease patients because they feel they have nowhere else to turn.   these patients mostly present as one of two types:  the first type has been told they have advanced lyme disease, and they come to us after years of treatment, usually regimens of intense antibiotics, without any lasting improvement � in many cases their symptoms have just gone from bad to worse.   most come with neurological symptoms, and some even arrive in wheelchairs.   the second type has been told that their mysterious symptoms today are explained by an undetected lyme infection years ago, and that if they had only been treated then with antibiotics they would never have their problems today.   but treatment today yields no benefit.   unfortunately for both types, the only treatment offered by conventional medicine is antibiotics, lots and lots of them, sometimes delivered in massive doses via intravenous ports.   the truth is, this treatment is doomed to failure from the start, and will only worsen the patient's symptoms over time.   how can this be? because the ""lyme bacteria"", borrelia, is not the cause of the diagnosis of ""lyme disease"" � it is only a coincidental infection, which can be detected with a lab test.   but this lab test, if positive, doesn't correlate to the expression of the disease, which has totally different causes!  the perspective of biological medicine is so different that it shocks many of our lyme patients.   let's begin by noting that 90% of the forest workers in switzerland test positive for lyme disease.   logging is a major industry here and it involves hard physical work.   why do these men show no symptoms of lyme disease, and continue to enjoy robust good health?   we tell all our patients: the fact that you are positive for lyme does not explain your condition.   at paracelsus we frankly don't view lyme as a distinct disease.  instead, it is a syndrome of symptoms commonly associated with poor health, especially of the immune system.   the test for lyme disease only shows whether a patient was ever exposed to lyme, which for a healthy person is just another minor infection.   while a lyme exposure may have added to the burden on the body, so may have other infectious agents.   these infections are opportunistic, preying on the weak. rather than focus on strengthening the body, as we do in biological medicine, conventional treatment adds to the problem.   massive doses of antibiotics compromise the immune system, and toxic bacteria then flourish, overwhelming neurological and organ function and eventually debilitating the patient.   and that is usually when they come to us.  our stage 3 lyme patients are always quite ill when they arrive. in every one of them we find significant toxic loads, mainly heavy metals, chronic viruses, and severe imbalance in their inner metabolic milieu, plus adrenal fatigue and even neurotoxic bacteria in their intestines � all due to antibiotics! very often, as a significant co-factor, these patients have a serious impairment of their metabolic detoxification pathways as well insufficient essential fatty acids and trace elements � issues for which conventional doctors, even ""lyme specialists"", don't even test!  our treatment for lyme patients is very successful but takes time to undo the damage from years of poor health and antibiotics. you simply can't rebuild the body overnight. but we have countless cases considered incredible by the treating physician at home. patients who had almost given up hope resume their normal lives. this is why our lyme practice grows so dramatically � it isn't really because of an epidemic of the disease. the epidemic is of treatment failure. paracelsius treatment line for lyme disease"^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
it looks very similar to when i first got lyme.  i got a tick, got the em rash, took doxy, was then positive for elisa and westernblot.  the rash disappeared, no symptoms.  about a month after antibiotic, strange symptoms appeared, nothing too bad, but funny stuff like you describe.  these increased fast, i declined very fast. about 4 months after that, i was in bed, barely able to stand up.  westernblot had become negative (i did 3 of them, only the first was positive, before doxy).  my daughter was bitten a year after me. she was 2, and she had tummy problems right away, after tick bite. in a month after tick bite, despite amoxy, she got so many symptoms, including arthritis.  it takes years for some people to manifest symptoms after an infected bite. some people never get symptoms, even.  but some people, like daughter and i, had symptoms either right away after bite, or in a couple of weeks. in less than 6 months, we had a full blown lyme disease, in the brain, spine, gut, eyes, joints, you name the place...  with treatment, we improved and now we are both lyme free.  look for proper help. normal doctors cannot help because they will never believe on lyme with a negaitve westernblot.  there are special labs in the us (like igenex) that are more sensitive.^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
sorry to take so long responding to this, it's been a crazy few weeks for me.   so i finally got my blood results back from my llmd and it came back cdc positive on the western blot. so i do officially have lyme. which i'm happy to find out only because knowing is much better than wondering and waiting.   my cardiologist told me i have arrhythmia and a potential bundle branch block. she actually said to start the antibiotics because it may help resolve the issues.   i did start doxy a week and a half ago and that was just to start something before i see my llmd. my difficulty catching my breath and chest pain went away about a week into the doxy.   so i suppose that's a good sign. although a few days after feeling great i started feeling bad again. not sure what that means.   lyme husband and dad; thanks for the link. i have checked out dr. burrascano's protocols many times. if i wasn't able to see the dr soon that was going to be my next option. along with buhner's protocol.   hopingandpraying; thanks for all the info. i have an appointment to see a llmd this friday. yes she is in nj but she came highly recommended. we know three people personally who said she saved their lives.   and she is also currently treating my boyfriend. hopefully she will be able to tell me if i have any co-infections so we can treat those as well.   lymetoo; you were right!   cat girl; yes, thank goodness my dr came highly recommended. and i'm thinking you're right, this may be more than lyme.   i do have buhner's books and all the herbs he recommends for lyme, bartonella, and babesia. i got all that in september when my bf was diagnosed. so i feel extra prepared!   and thanks for the reassurance. for a while i was obsessed, (ok maybe still am a little, lol) but so worried and sad and upset. then i realized, that's not gonna help me get better.   i will try whatever the llmd gives me and keep my mind and my options open. i consider myself lucky actually because my symptoms aren't debilitating.   i also feel lucky that my bf had it first, so i was aware of it and knew the signs and symptoms from all my research and the drs that we saw for him.   and... i feel like i'm really helping myself with my diet and agree that gluten, sugar, and dairy free is the way to go. i've actually been eating that way for a long time now and i feel like i would be much worse if i wasn't.   i know that's the hardest part for some people. my boyfriend included!   thank you everyone for all your help. it's crazy and scary and wonderful to know that so many people out there have lyme, but so many people want to help one another to get better.   i'll keep you posted.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

hi everyone, i have googled everything lyme related for the past 6 months and just need educated opinions.  my boyfriend who is a landscaper was diagnosed with lyme in early september. we basically thought he was dying. couldn't move. terrible muscle, joint, and bone pain. i had to dress him and take care of him.  he was on doxy for three months and three months later in november he finally saw a lyme specialist and was diagnosed with babesia and bartonella as well. he is finally getting better, thank god.  once we suspected lyme in september we stopped having sex just in case. i didn't want to get it, in case it was sexually transmitted.  then, mid october, my stomach started bothering me, couldn't really eat anything. got worse and worse until i basically could only eat chicken and vegetables and a few basic carbs. had stomach pain, uneasiness, heartburn, and reflux all the time.  in january i cut out carbs completely. just reintroduced complex carbs and those are fine. my stomach has gotten better, but if i deviate from my diet at all i feel like i'm dying.  i figured it was just a gi issue, but then in january i started having chest pains, then shortness of breath, and chest discomfort.  i also could not sleep laying down anymore. i have to sleep upright otherwise my stomach hurts, i have difficulty breathing and i get a very uneasy feeling.  i was sent to a cardiologist and had an abnormal stress test, (my heart beat changed) and a holter monitor showed i had sinus tachycardia and sinus arrhythmia, and an extra heart beat. the dr said we will follow up with a stress echo (in 5 weeks!) to see what's going on.  i'm a 35 year old female. heart problems out of no where? my primary always tells me i'm in perfect shape. bloodwork always comes back great every year. no high blood pressure, no high cholesterol, no family history of heart disease.  but my last bloodwork just came back positive for igm p23. primary said its negative. but i'm finally just putting all of the pieces together. maybe my stomach issues have been lyme?  my chest discomfort and breathing issues are extremely uncomfortable and making me really nervous and upset. my boyfriend just says to start taking doxy until i see his lyme doc in three weeks.  opinions???

"lyme does not follow the rules that apply to other diseases. with other diseases, one means early infection and the other means later infection.  but, with lyme, there is basically no difference between igg and igm. if you have any positives on lyme specific bands on either one, it indicates lyme.  usually, the test marks the lyme-specific bands with an asterisk or some other way.  or, you can check burrascano and other lyme sites for the lyme-specific bands.  ""the 18kd, 23-25kd (osp c), 31kd (osp a), 34kd (osp b), 37kd, 39kd, 83kd and the 93kd bands are the species-specific ones, but appear later or may not appear at all. you should see at least the 41kd and one of the specific bands. 55kd, 60kd, 66kd, and 73kd are nonspecific and nondiagnostic.""

"i don't know if i had posted a treatment history:  2006-complete exhaustion, sensitive to light/sound, twitchy eyes, slowly became unable to work  -drs told me i was depressed and anxious-tried every anti-depressant imaginable, couldn't tolerate most of them. had so much therapy, i could teach a college course on it. nothing helped.  2007/08-trigeminal neuralgia-treated with multiple rounds of antibiotics, ironically this made me well enough to work in 2008.  8/08-bit by something on my honeymoon (spider, tick, or something) had huge rash-ish thing that wouldn't heal.  almost immediately i went downhill and could no longer work due to sound/twitchiness/exhaustion.  i was still told i just had depression and anxiety.  10/09 my son was born. he had autism traits.  3/11 started having fevers/extreme fatigue for no reason and sensitivity to light and sound and balance problems.  -i was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder at 36 yrs old! i even started ot and vision therapy because i wanted to get my life back.  6/11 id dr treatd me for ehrlichia w/ 2 wks doxy.  felt great for 2 months. felt better than i had my entire life. i even felt i no longer needed my therapist and psychiatrist...the ""anxiety and depression"" were gone. i never knew doxy was an anti-depressant  9/11 had a flu shot...then slowly fevers/exhaustion returned. this time i started having brain fog and weird headaches. one night the brain fog was so thick, my little son was talking to me and i could not figure out how to say a word.  early winter 2011-started seeing an llmd. i kept getting sicker and sicker. i thought it was the llmd's fault. (was on oral abx and many supplements)  took son to see llmd as a shot in the dark. he was igg positive for lyme. within 1 month of tx he was speaking conversationally and making eye contact.  then took husband to see if his ""auto-immune"" issues were related. he was igg and igm positive for lyme and bunches of other infections due to prednisone and cellcept use. in fact during his first 3 months of treatment, he was weaning off of the immunosuppressants.  spring 2012-my husband and i went to the best of the best. my husband was on orals and then iv. he kept making amazing progress.  however, from spring-nov 2012 i kept getting worse and worse the more things they would add. (was on many, many oral abx and bicillin la, glutathione iv and suppositories, b12 injections, and on and on).  11/12-hospitalized with sepsis. immune system now shot. i now have recurrent uti's.  started seeing a dr k trained art practitioner who diagnosed parasites, viruses, mold, lyme, ehrlichia, babesia.  when i did a 2 day round of biltricide, i passed liver flukes and felt pretty good those days.  did 14 day round of pyrantel-wiped me out.  i am now beginning my second round of pyrantel pamoate, started valtrex and lyrica.  i cannot detox at all.  i am grateful for gael, catgirl, tammy n and the others who kept screaming ""treat parasites!""  -------------------- ? ? ? ? ?

"chris, first know what kinds of tests were done on you. the 4/12/06 is an eia test. the 5/1/08 is also an eia test.  here is what you have to know about an eia test: it is a screening test only. see what 2 famous lyme doctors say about the eia:  ""it's important to know that screening tests like the eia, elisa, ifa and pcr can be negative even when the western blot (confirmatory test) is positive.  i presented research that supported this at the 1994 international lyme borreliosis conference held in bologna, italy.  for this reason i believe the screening tests are practically worthless, and is why i use the western blot to ``screen'' for borreliosis, even though it is a ``confirmatory'' test. ""  from dr. c's explanation of the western blot found here:  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=042077;p=0  dr. burrascano remarks on screening tests like the eia this way:  ""the suggestion that two-tiered testing, utilizing an elisa as a screening tool, followed, if positive, by a confirmatory western blot, is illogical in this illness. the elisa is not sensitive enough to serve as an adequate screen, and there are many patients with lyme who test negative by elisa yet have fully diagnostic western blots. i therefore recommend against using the elisa. order igm and igg western blots..."" (p. 7)  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  so, what you learn from this is that the times you were tested by eia, you were tested with a lousy test that lyme doctors know not to use. this test is so lousy that it can say you are negative for lyme when a western blot test will say you are positive for lyme.  so, the test you want is the western blot.  your 4/12/06 eia showed a weak positive on the igm. it is called ""equivocal"" which means not negative but not positive enough to be called positive. so, this is some evidence of possible lyme by the lousy eia test.  the 8/10/06 eia showed no evidence of lyme. since the eia is such a lousy test, this is a common result for those with lyme.  the 5/1/08 eia test now had your igm at a level of 1 which is no longer in the normal range but now actually positive on the igm for lyme. however, if you had lyme in the past and were treated for it, then this would be a normal reading for you.  so, did you have lyme and were you treated for it in the past (meaning prior to 5/1/08)?  if the answer is that you were not treated for lyme prior to 5/1/08, then this test result is significant and indicates lyme disease.  but, if you were treated for lyme in the past and cured of it, then this result means nothing. (i still test positive for lyme 12 years after being cured and symptom-free.)  the message i want you to get, however, is that all of these tests are considered worthless by lyme specialists.  now, you have a few other tests with numbers in 2 columns. these are called immunoblot igg.  these are the igg part of a western blot. a western blot, however, always has 2 parts: igg and igm. with chronic lyme patients, it is normally the igm that will be positive. ""chronic"" means you didn't just get bit a week ago but likely a year or more ago, more or less.  ""but actually, more igm blots are positive in chronic borreliosis than igg."" that's a quote from dr. c., same lyme doc as quoted above.  so, it looks like you have just the igg half of some western blots. do you think you have the igm immunoblots somewhere?  on your igg pages, you have all of these number which represent various ""bands"" by molecular weight. read dr. c's explanation of the western blot to understand this.  near the end, he tells which of these numbers is significant for lyme. burrascano tells the same on page 7 of the guidelines.  you have many band numbers listed that i have never seen reported. they are not lyme bands is my guess. do you think you were tested for something else like syphilis, etc.? many, many of the band numbers are not lyme band numbers. for example:  85, 69, 77, 56 on the 4/12/06 igg. there were 2 bands on that test that are lyme bands and those are 45 and 41. i am assuming here that when they put a band number on your test result, that likely means you were positive on that band.  on the 8/10/06 immunoblot igg (meaning the igg portion of a western blot) you had bands 58, 34, and 39 which are lyme bands, and 72 and 61 which are not part of a lyme western blot as far as i know.  so, if the listing of these bands means that they were present in your test, then you have band 39 which is a very significant band for lyme showing up on that test. see what dr. c says about band 39: ""39: unknown what this antigen is, but based on research at the national institute of health (nih), other borrelia (such as borrelia recurrentis that causes relapsing fever), do not even have the genetics to code for the 39 kda antigen, much less produce it. it is the most specific antibody for borreliosis of all.""  in plain english, similar/related diseases such as relapsing fever cannot possibly cause band 39 to show up. only lyme can cause a positive or present on this band.  so, this is very significant if what it means is that band 39 showed up on the immunoblot test for you. i think it is common sense to assume that the numbers listed are the bands that your blood reacted to or showed up on as present. so, this is a good indication that you had lyme at that time or some time in the past (and were treated for it and ""cured"").  then, on 5/2/08, your immunoblot igg showed the following bands which point to lyme: 41, 66, 30, and 58. dr. c says that 30 is the same as 31 and that 66 points to lyme. dr. burrascano does not consider 66 as significant for lyme. nevertheless, this test is showing some evidence of your body's reaction to the lyme bacteria.  what were you told regarding all of these results?  i am not familiar with the lab that was used. lyme specialists often use igenex, and that is the lab we see so much more often--and it is a complete western blot igg and igm panel. so, i could be making some mistakes in assuming what these test results are, but it is not too likely that these are mistakes in understanding what they gave you.  if the lab has an interpretation page for the immunoblot igg, check their website, that should be added to the images you uploaded so we can be sure of what those tests mean.  each of your immunoblot igg test results list a number of bands that are not reported for lyme testing includng 74, 77, 61,and 72 so it would be good to know if these were strictly lyme tests or tests for other diseases.  the western blot is used for other diseases besides lyme.  as i said above, it is more often the igm results that will be positive for a long-time lyme patient. if you could post any igm results, that would be more helpful.  also, please know that once a person has had lyme and been treated for it, none of these tests can possibly tell you if you still have lyme. you must go by symptoms if the person had lyme in the past. (or a totally different test--one that looks directly for the lyme bacteria.)  you will understand this a lot better if you read all of dr. c's explanation of the western blot. it is the best explanation for the layman that i have encountered.  please understand that these tests are not looking for lyme itself. rather, they are looking to see if your body made antibodies to lyme. antibodies are a reaction to the presence of lyme in a healthy person with a functioning immune system.  the trouble is that a person sick with lyme doesn't have a normally functioning immune system. it is suppressed or compromised by the lyme. so, many of the sickest lyme patients get negative western blots. then, when they get good lyme treatment and their immune system starts to recover, they often get positive western blots.  if you have many lyme symptoms, that is the greatest evidence of lyme in your body. if you want a good lyme test done, get a western blot from igenex. costs about $200.  just know that these tests cannot be relied upon to make a diagnosis. you must use medical history, test results, symptoms and your reaction to a trial course of lyme meds to make the final diagnosis. burrascano says that on page 7 of the guidelines.  hope this helps you!"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"i am really surprised that nobody responded to this post. here is another article about the situation.  ann - oh http://www.charlotte.com/mld/charlotte/13428496.htm  posted on sat, dec. 17, 2005  doctor accused of inappropriate care diagnosis, treatment of lyme disease was mishandled, notice says  karen garloch kgarloch@charlotteobserver.com  dr. joseph jemsek, an infectious disease specialist who treated the first aids patient in mecklenburg county in 1983, has been accused by the n.c. medical board of inappropriately diagnosing and treating lyme disease.  in a dec. 9 notice, the board alleges jemsek treated at least five patients with long-term intravenous antibiotics for lyme disease when he had ""no historical, physical, serological or other laboratory evidence"" to support that diagnosis.  the board has scheduled a public hearing feb. 15.  jemsek, 56, said he disagrees with the allegations and will vigorously defend himself. ""we're proud of what we do,"" he said, ""and we've helped hundreds of people.""  lyme disease is a bacterial infection usually transmitted by a tick bite. in north carolina, the number of reported cases has risen from 47 in 2000 to 111 in 2004.  symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue and a characteristic ""bull's eye"" skin rash. when caught early, lyme disease can be treated with oral antibiotics. when treatment is delayed, daily intravenous antibiotics are required. medical guidelines suggest therapy for 14 to 28 days.  but jemsek treats patients longer. for each of the five patients, ""in the absence of any research,"" jemsek prescribed intravenous antibiotics for several months, the board said. also, the board said jemsek didn't adequately inform patients that his treatment is a departure from standards.  jemsek, who opened an hiv clinic in huntersville in 2000, said he became interested in lyme disease because patients have been ""sort of abandoned. they're challenging. they're complex. ... i saw a real need to address this.""  earlier this year, he said, he spoke about lyme disease at duke university medical center, the n.c. health department and a united kingdom conference on tick-borne illness.  jemsek has practiced medicine in charlotte since 1979, when he joined the now-defunct nalle clinic.  one of his patients, karen lilly of mooresville, contacted the observer this year to praise jemsek for diagnosing her lyme disease after she'd been to more than 15 doctors.  lilly said she became ill in may 2001 with hives from head to toe, extreme fatigue, joint pain and numbness in her limbs.  various doctors told her it was anxiety, nerves, allergies or multiple sclerosis. in january 2003, she was referred to jemsek. he told her the symptoms suggested lyme but he couldn't make a certain diagnosis ""until we get positive test results.""  when blood tests came back positive, she started daily intravenous antibiotic therapy. her insurance stopped covering that treatment a year ago, so she takes antibiotics orally. she remains disabled and has mild dementia, but she said she has improved.  dr. david weber, an infectious disease specialist at unc chapel hill medical school, said he is not aware of data that supports antibiotic therapy for lyme disease for longer than a month. he is not connected to jemsek's case, but agreed to talk to the observer about lyme disease in general.  long-term intravenous therapy carries an increased risk of infection, weber said, because bacteria can contaminate the ""central line,"" a tube that stays in a patient temporarily to deliver medicine.  ? 2005 charlotte observer and wire service sources.  -------------------- www.ldbullseye.com"^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

"when i was buying new coverage several years ago this is what i found for pennsylvania. i could buy insurance with a pre-existing condition, but coverage for that condition would be delayed for a period of time. i do not remember how long that was, but something like 6-12 months.  i did not have a lapse in coverage and went from one group, my ex-husbands, to another, self-employed, group. it seems to me that if i was buying insurance as an individual, same insurance company, it would have been tougher to get coverage with a pre-existing.  i didn't have a pre-existing, but had been diagnosed with lyme and treated for one month about 8 months before changing companies. this is when most doctors still believed lyme was cured in a month. i was later treated long term for lyme. i guess i got it again.  many years ago, when i was in the ""real"" business world, we had an employee whose wife had diabetes. she was covered for other illnesses but not for the diatetes. she was a dependant and if i remember during open enrollment could be covered.  i hope this is somewhat useful.  mel"^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

"wow,you have my head spinning! and i don't have lyme! i am working here with a reasonably functional brain, and i can't grasp all of this! all i know is that when i take my daughter to doctors and am met with a condescending attitude when i bring up lyme disease; when our llmd is hesitant to share her notes with the insurance company as per their request because he/she does not want to attact medical board attention; when i read that lyme is hard to get, easy to treat according to researchers from respected academic institutions; when i see lyme disease show up on bioterrorism lab lists, labs run by those very same researchers; when i read that the federal government participated in funding and developing a vaccine for this easy to get, hard to treat disease, again with the involvement of these very same men mentioned above, things just don't add up! proof or no proof, there is clearly enough information to cause every doctor, legislator and citizen to question and reconsider the history and complexity and virulence of this disease . and surely their attitude would change! surely, they would ask the same questions i am asking: ""why, if it is hard to get and easy to treat, did you find it important to develop a vaccine for it?"" why, if it is hard to get and easy to treat, would it be a potential agent for bioterrorism?"" ""why are medical boards so intent on stopping doctors from treating this disease; and if it is because the treatment protocol is unsafe, then why are they charged with improper diagnosis, rather than unsafe treatment protocol?"" ""if treatment is not unsafe, then why do you care what these family doctors are doing? why are you so interested in this small group of doctors when you have much more important things to do?"" i am terribly afraid that if we are not able to validate the chronic nature of this disease, we will soon have no doctors and no insurance coverage! my modest dream is that one day soon, i will walk into a specialist's office and have him say that he now realizes that chronic lyme disease is indeed a complex illness and that it does impact his specialty! then, maybe he will start trying to find out why and how; and then maybe my wildest dream will come true - a cure!  btw, lou, i would be interested in your take on the ""conflicts of interest"" link on the lda website."^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
well let me see  there was a handfull of cases in the 70s and now there maybe 200,000 a year.  nobody actually knows the amount of lyme cases because we have no reliable blood test.  there is no way of knowing that this bacteria is ever gone from your body.most doctors will tell you that you are cured after 28 days even though you have symptoms and are getting worse.youre getting sicker yet they have the nerve to tell you youre cured without any proof.  thousands of patients have testified that they have gotten better from long term treatment and still the other side cant even have the compassion to look into this to see if there is any merit.  the cdc makes a horrible criteria  the cdc makes lyme tests sound accurate.  doctors who treat lyme are persecuted  patients have to pay for treatment because insurance companies wont pay for long term treatment.  thats the tip of the iceberg,feel free to add to this list.  what do you think of getting a bulk postage and mailing this to millions.  i like this one,we could get some attention,why dont we put an ad like this in all the big newspapers over and over and over.this info will scare people and they should be,how they have handled lyme is scary,and an outrage,lets make it known.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
if i had a dollar for every time an insurance rep gave me the wrong info...  you can call 5 times on the same day and ask the same question. i guarantee that you'll get 5 different answers.  if your policy clearly states that you do not have out-of-network benefits, then they did make a mistake (happened to my husband before) and are not likely to make the same mistake again. you'll get to keep their check though.  when it happened to my husband, we tried to fight it with everything we had. we even requested phone calls transcripts to build our case (were told only some calls are recorded for customer service improvement).  after several pretty stressful months, we decided to let it go. his policy clearly stated that he didn't have out-of-network coverage (although we didn't understand it that way at first and were told over the phone that he would with this specific doctor).  i don't know about you but personally, fighting lost causes stresses me more than paying the bills.  some will tell you they managed to win insurance battles, and that's true. but if your policy states something on paper, there's little you can do about it.  good luck with your treatment!^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
i'm just curious if there is anything i can do about this:  i have a hmo health insurance that does not cover out-of-network physicians or blood labs.  as like many of us, our llmd does not take insurance and is out-of-network.  my health insurance does pay for all my medications, minus the co-pay.  when i started with my first llmd, i called my insurance company and asked if a referral to the out-of-network physician would be considered for reimbursement. i was told no. therefore, i never had a referral to see any llmd.  the llmd i see now has her patients pay upfront and the llmd office sends in a claim for the benefit of their patients.  i never expected to see a dime.  my insurance company sent me a remibursement, minus my copay, for one of my appointments and then sent my doctor a decent $200 reimbursement for my inital $500 visit.  my husband never received anything even though he sees our llmd also, on the same dates.  the llmd's office told me to call my insurance company and have them re-issue the check to me, since i had already paid my llmd. i called today and the girl said she would do so and, to expect my check in the mail.  against my better judgment (my husband thought i should ask), i asked her why i was getting reimbursed and my husband was not.  she said that it was because the llmd was my primary physician but was not my husband's. i told her that we both had the same primary. she said that it was because i had a referral and my husband didn't. i said, ok, i didn't think i had a referral but i guess i did (i knew i didn't).  she then said that i did not have a referral and i would not get this check re-issued to me. that it had been a mistake.  i asked, if i had had a referral, would i have gotten that check and she said yes. i then asked if i could send in a referral in order to get this re-imbursement and she said yes. she gave me the fax number to fax it to.  i then asked, so as long as i have a referral, i will be reimbursed for all my appointments? she said yes (and, boy, did i get excited).  i said, how can i get reimbursed for a blood lab that is out-of-network. she said just have your primary give you a referral.  i called back about an hour later just to verify what this girl had told me. i asked if a referral would get me reimbursed for all the visits my husband and i have seen this doctor. the new customer service rep said no, referrals don't count when it's an out of network doctor. i told her what the girl before had said to me and she transfered me to a supervisor.  as many of you probably know, the supervisor's aren't the nicest, customer oriented people.  anyway, she said that i had misunderstood the first girl and i would have only been considered for re-imbursement (a one-time reimbursement) if my primary had sent me to the doctor with a referral thinking that the doctor was in-network and it had been a mistake.  she said that i am aware that i am not allowed to see out-of-network physicians and therefore a referral will not be considered for reimbursement ever. she said a referral will never work for an out-of-network physician or blood lab.  she said i should have never been reimbursed for anything.  i asked what i needed to do to take this further (just curious) and she said there was nothing to take further. she said if the claim could be denied, i could go through the appeal process but that an out-of-network physician is not even considered for re-imbursement, per their policy, and so the appeal process was not available to me.  she said i could have had my physician to call their special authorization line for a one time visit but the fact that they have many good physicians in-network who can see me for my lyme that there was no reason for me to have to go out-of-network (or something to that extent). (impo, i don't think my primary would do that for me anyway).  by now she was extremely ticked at me. when i said that i was seeing an out-of-network doctor because their in-network doctors could not diagnose me for more than three years and, due to the medical community being naive, many with lyme are in the same boat as me and have to see out-of-network providers, she became furious (she shouldn't have asked what i was seeing the out-of-network physician for and why not a in-network physician). then told me that she wasn't going to argue with me (i wasn't arguing with her or being rude, i just stated the fact).  first off, i'm worried that the first check they sent me will be expected back now. i never mentioned it but who knows if she noticed it or will go through my file with a fine-tooth comb now.  i'm also worried i may have started something i didn't need to/want to. no idea what kind of repercussions (sp?) there could be but i'm a little worried. is there any way they can deny the prescriptions my llmd writes me??? that would = us not getting treatment. no way we could afford to pay for our llmd and our prescriptions out of pocket.  i'm also ticked. before all of this, i just didn't care that i wasn't going to get reimbursed. now, though, i feel that i *should* be reimbursed. i'm paying for health insurance. i'm paying for a service. it's ridiculous that i'm paying more for our monthly llmd visits than i am paying for my medical insurance - that doesn't even cover our doctor visits! how does that make sense?!?!?!?!?!  is there any way to fight them when it comes to out-of-network physicians and services??? is it worth it? can they cancel your insurance if you try to?^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
i understand your hurt and frustration. this disease is so isolating. i had a friend who described lymenet as a cult. (i used to forward or copy interesting posts to her; her 13 year old daughter had 5/6 bulls eye rashes this past june and received doxi 200mg for a month.)  we with lyme live with daily worry about insurance - our doctor's medical licenses - our family's futures.......  not much of a quality of life.  everyone here understands your feelings and reaches out.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
man, i feel like a beaten puppy!  it looks like my iv meds will not get approved. if they do, it will probably only be for 28 days (yes, i posted that on the medical forum too). the funny thing is, i feel almost at peace with it!  i attended a prayer group meeting at our church last week. i knew then and there that i had to turn all this over to god. i cant keep up the battle-fighting with the dr's, fighting with the insurance. will this or that cure it?? what if i try this? what if i dont do that? i had to give up and put god back in charge.  im whipped and tired. a good mentor to me even told me that it was time that i let others do the praying for me. what a strange thing to say i thought at the time, but she is right. she said that sometimes a person comes to a point where they just cant do the prayers anymore and you have to put others in charge of it.  so ok, thats what i am doing. im still praying, but letting others do more of the work for me. i have kids to take care of. i break into tears every single time i think about not being around to take care of them.  today, i could hardly life my head off the pillow. i took my 2 year old to a friends house and let her take charge of her for a bit. i slept but i am still so out of it tonight. im in tears even now.  i want to be strong again and raise my family. thats why, i have to put this in gods hands. i cant do it anymore.  nancy  -------------------- life is 10% what happens to you, 90% how you respond to it!  -chuck swindoll^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

i thought i would post my story to see if anyone has any advice. i am sure some of you have went through this too. any advice or tips would be great!!  my inusrance is united healthcare. since june of 2005 i had approval from my insurance to see my lyme literate doctor even though he is out of network.  my insurance doesnt take out of network doctors but made a waiver and with the information submitted they decided to accept him and pay as if he was an in network doctor.  so i have been covered and later date my husband needed to see the same doctor and we had to appeal and finally got my husband approval to see dr. c and it was being covered. so at this time our insurance company has been covering all expenses to see dr. c...  then my kids started to have problems, they went through some testing and also came up positive for lyme so here we are back to the insurance company trying to get them approval to see dr.c. on nov of 2005 i had received approval for the boys to see dr. c for 3 office visits. they stated they will cover for 3 visits.  so we all had a appointment with dr. c jan 5th and on jan 2nd i called the insurance company to notify them and to make sure approval was still good.. i was told everything is okay we are in the computer for coverage and i received confirmation numbers for each one of us.   so we all went to see dr. c and they last friday my insurance company called me and told me they will not cover for dr. c any more and that they have infectious disease doctors closer to us that will treat us and is in network.   my question is can they do this. can they cover us then stop all the sudden and not cover any more? my husband and i have approval to see him for 10 office visits and my children 3 office visits and non of us have had that many visits. once they start to cover dont they have to cover?  they cant cover for one and not the other in the household. i understand he is an out of net work doctor but i appealed and they approved so they should have to cover until we no longer see him. we have had no changes in our insurance so i dont know why after the new year they are doing this.. so if anyone has an advice please let me know.. i wont let this go without a fight. i feel that this is not right what they are doing...  i think that if they have covered they have to continue to cover. they cant just drop coverage when they were already covering.  i also wanted to state that nov of 2005 i talked to my care coordinater with the insurance company and she stated that my husband and i have approval for 10 office visits and the boys have approval for 3 office visits. and she told me to call after the new year so this can be put in the computer.. so they are playing games. i have that ladies number wrote down and her number and date she told me this... they are now saying that the approval to see dr c was only for year of 2005. which doesnt make any since because that lady new that the boys first appointment to see dr. c was jan 5th. anyways. thanks for listening and if anyone has advice please send it my way!! thank you.  my e-mail address is bbwagoner4@yahoo.com^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^1^0
hi jane, sorry to read your sad story, but glad you're being tested.  be sure to read my comments on igenex well...have them fax your dr. results! write on their form.  welcome to this 24/7 lyme support group board! here's treepatrol's and tincup's combination newbie links.  http://flash.lymenet.org/ubb/forum1/html/029917.html  print off the links then check them off as you read as you could spend several months reading all of this.  ==>> jane, print & read dr. barrascono's 2005 info first; you will come back to this often. i'd do this now based upon your having this earlier & your other health problems now!  also, see cheryl's extensive web sites on: ld diagnosis, symptoms, & treatment ... wonderful! read the area on co-infections! you could have from 1-12 other illnesses that tick is carrying...lyme, malaria, etc.  if you are showing symptoms of co-infections, i would like to suggest being tested for co-infections when you have lyme western blots done. it isn't cheap!! but if you are positive, you can treat the co-infections first, and then work on lyme symptoms.  http://www.lymeinfo.net/lymediseasetreatment.html  testing for lyme disease ... 3 main lyme tick borne labs in usa!  the western blot igm & igg blood test nos. 189 and 188, are the only accurate tests for ld. they should only be sent to these 3 usa's lyme testing labs:  igenex lab: 797 san antonio road palo alto, ca 94303 1.800.832.3200.  (if the early test, called igm, is negative; the later test igg is not done!) please see their web site: www.igenex.com call for their current prices effective oct. , 2005 and  to print their required form, which must be signed by the doctor, diagnosis code no. completed!; medicare's upin no., and your blood taken early in the week so it doesn't sit in post offices! example, have it taken mon. - wed. afternoon tests show more positive lyme results!  here is the site to print their required form to send with blood sample. for me, i printed the first option available on the forms.  http://www.igenex.com/formset2.htm   write on their forms you want results faxed to their drs. office; snail mail paper copy so it's not lost like mine was!  non-medicare patients must prepay by check or credit card for the tests since they do not handle insurance papers. medicare patients do not have to prepay!  2. mdlabs from nj, www.mdl.net see their site; they too require their own form. no prices are listed; you must call their 800 no.  3. bowen labs from florida, www.bowen.net 727.937.9077 you pay $250 tax-deductible payment for testing, and they send you a picture of what shows up in your blood. you also get the results within 24 hours after the blood is received at bowen. they are also a 501(c)(3) lab and you can take the donation of $250 off of your taxes if you live in the us. they fax the results and then about a week later send the actual pictures. lyme should be diagnosed clinically using medical history in addition with the western blot blood tests as no currently available test is definitive in ruling-in or ruling-out infection with ld pathogens, or whether these infections are responsible for the patient's symptoms.  note: please send a copy of your health insurance card to your insurance comany (mine is wellmark bc/bs, iowa) for them to submit to blue card (handles other states) them to forward to california's blue shield health insurance company since they will require that, drs. diagnosis code no., and which date of service is correct (igx has 3 different dates on their paid receipts....use the date of activity!).  fyi - mine was returned to me after 6 wks. after submitting; dr./blood lab failed to show drs. diagnosis code no. on their form! it went to 7 people to be returned to me! disgusting!^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
lymetoo, for (i hope) the last time:  there are some doctors in ohio who are knowledgeable and experienced in treating lyme disease. i have stated that so repeatedly here, that i am tired of myself saying it.  please do not tell people there are no doctors treating people in ohio. just tell them to e-mail me at tbdbullseye@aol.com.  yikes has been in touch with me and i have sent information - actually lives within 10 miles of me.  i know the doctors in ohio as i was a support group leader for 11 years and have a website and an e-list. i know their patients and am in contact with patients who see the doctors.  i know how dedicated you are to dr. c. i too admire him emensely and i recommend him to people who can travel that far.  it is easier - and the only option for some people - to get to a doctor nearer home. some can't afford long trips and or have insurance limitations.  i thought i sent you a list of the doctors i know treat in ohio. if not, please e-mail me.  just don't say there is no hope for people who can't travel outside ohio. please.  thanks and a hug ann in ohio  -------------------- www.ldbullseye.com^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
i can't help with the insurance ... i was lucky my company paid.  i am only a lyme patient ..... but my opion is that that fibro and post lyme syndrome is bs ...  if someone has cancer and you give them 4 weeks of meds and they still have the same symtoms would you suddenly call it something else because they had a lousy 4 weeks of meds...  of course not... it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that they still have cancer and need more meds...  yet with lyme it seems like most drs. are willing to throw all logic out the window label you post lyme or fibro and be done with you......  washed their hands clean of the risk to their liscense that you would pose as someone who needs long term antibotics.  it infurates me so....ive been there... but now i have a great llmd....  that is what you need a great llmd...... and if your insurance co wont pay for abx you may be able to qulaify for needy meds.... i know the website is somewhere on here try to do a search for it.  i am 29 now but i have had lyme since i was 10 yrs old so i know how tough it is to be a kid and deal with lyme symptoms.....  just so you know i went undiagnosed untreated for 13 yrs then i had some inadequate treatment and tons of complications... from what i have seen it usually does not take as long as me to get better  your daughter can get better and get her life back to normal with treatment under the care of a good llmd.  best wishes  -------------------- multiple chemical sensitvity group: http://www.lymefriends.com/group/multiplechemicalsensitivities  group for artists. all media welcome: http://www.lymefriends.com/group/creativecorner   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lyme_artist^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

thanks! it does help to know that i am not the only one in this boat.  i just recently talked to my llmd- it would be so wonderful if he were closer so i could get a little more hand holding during all of this.  as it turns out i will be starting mepron- yikes $$$$$$! but treating the babs is necessary.  my neuro has agreed to call and talk to him- i have no idea how that will go.  i also have no idea what will happen if she agrees with him what will happen. i don't know if she can over rule the id in the insurance ruling.  i hate this whole mess.  my hope is that treating the babs will really help me get on to getting better and it won't matter what all these ducks think.  thanks for the support!   i am very thankful that i found a llmd and that with some major scrimping we can afford to pay for the meds and visits. it is disgusting that so many people need to go this way. america should be ashamed of it medical care.  -------------------- lucy^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
bless your heart, hang in there. i personally can't stand docs. i ahve always tried everything to avoid them if i could. i rarely if ever trust them.  i don't feel that way about my llmd. he is great. i don't currently have a pcp. i haven't found one i trust.  ofcourse my insurance doesn't cover my llmd. so we pay out of pocket. my supplements are all paid out of pocket.  just recently found out my insurance is investigating me. so what little they do pay for. labs, antibiotics, { wich they would not refill this last time} ect. may be dropped.  so please stay positive, & know your not alone. i'll send good vibes your way.  love & light^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

"as usual, after reading your comments regarding john's hopkins, i got to thinking about what other alternatives there are out there.  i decided to call the md llmd to check out their procedures & policies. apparently, they cannot accept my insurance & i would have to pay up front for a visit.  so i asked how much an intake visit would cost? she said about $600-700, whooooaaaa! how is anyone supposed to be able to pay that much???  i lost my job due to my illness and my husband can't even manage the monthly bills on his own without some financial help from his parents.  i am also going to have to file for bankruptcy for bills i had been paying on before i got sick 3 years ago, and been unable to pay since then.  i keep getting harassed by creditor calls, who i can't even talk to on the phone 'cuz i am deaf and they don't call thru a tty or relay service.  yet they keep calling and calling and i can't rest in peace without having to get up and check the caller id, in case it's someone from the school calling about my children or something.  i just went to see a legal aide and was adviced that i may not have to file for bankruptcy but to send out ""judgment proof notification letters"" to all the creditors that i am unable to pay to. i am not sure how this works, but that is another new thing i am forced to learn about, all because i got lyme disease.  anyway, i am still not sure how to go about getting myself to see a llmd yet. i guess nothing would beat having a fat bank account, then i can go see the right doctors and get the proper treatment.  how do any of you guys handle the financial issues when needing to see an llmd who doesn't accept health insurance??"^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
since the topic of this thread regards llmd in maryland, something else just popped up yesterday that i want to share with you.  i just been to see my pcp for a follow-up along with a bunch more questions, including his quest for an llmd to refer me to. he said he was unable to locate one in the area, and suggested sending me to john hopkins to see a lyme specialist there.  he suggested i go there first because my insurance said they would cover it. i don't know much about llmd at john hopkins hospital/university, but i do know that they do some research on lyme.  i am trying to be hopeful and positive that this will lead me closer to getting the appropriate treatment for my case and getting a bunch of my questions answered, since each of us are individuals and need to be treated differently.  i wonder if any of you have ever been to john hopkins to see a lyme specialist there?? if so, how does it work out?^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
hi moose,  i see dr. l. i would recommend her.  i have had a few negitive issues at the office, but they are being worked out. most importatnly i have been improving.  i think they stopped filing insurance.  i always pay up front and you must see her once a month. but it has been worth it.  she told me about the free conference at the community college on the eastern shore, march 25.  maybe if other options fail you could ask hearing asl student to go with you for translation practice, or school credit or something like that. just a thought... e.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
has anyone ever applied for grants to help pay for all the money this disease cost? are there any available? i am waiting to see if ss is going to approve my disability application.  my insurance doesn't cover my llmd {of course} & i can't bare the thought of going to duck. it only covers 70% of labs. which isn't much.  they are already investigating me, and gave me trouble about filling my last abx perscription. {i had to get off of them any way. they were making my neuro syptoms way worse then just your typical herx.}  i am going this week to get the cortef {for adrenal insufiency} filled lets see what happens then.  insurance doesn't cover supplements that keep me going, & of course there is no coverage for alternative therapy either, ozone oxygen saunas, accupunture, ect.  i just bought a rife machine. that was a chunk of money. hopefully worth every penny.  my hubs a waiter thats our only income. we have two small kids and i can't work. the credit cards are already filled.   anybody have any ideas? would love to here them. love & light^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
you have been given some excellent advice. i am still fighting with my insurance hoping to convince them to take over the payment at some point. i am not waiting on treatment for them.  i fly out of state and see a wonderful llmd. it was amazing how different i felt after spending the 2+ hour initial visit with him- someone finally knew what was going on with me and was going to help me. it is worth it to reorder my life to make it happen. it angers me that so many of us have to pay despite having insurance and have such horrible journey to get that diagnosis.  good luck!  -------------------- lucy^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
hi, pamela and welcome!  you've already received some good, sound advice.  i just wanted to talk about the money issues you raised in your initial post.  when i was first searching for a good doctor who could treat this awful disease, i initially thought i'd get someone who was in my insurance network.  after doing some research, though, i realized that many of the best lyme-literate doctors are out of network (you'll understand the reasons for this if you just hang out here long enough).  i'm self-employed. i do have insurance, but i didnt have any money to spare. again, i thought i would let that guide me.  in the end, i opted to go out of state, to see a doctor who didn't take insurance. i chose this doctor, because she came very highly recommended by several of her patients on this board.  pamela, that was the best decision i've made for myself in years.  for me, everything started with that doctor and my initial appointment with her.  it wasn't inexpensive, insurance or no insurance. in fact, i wasn't really prepared for the cost. but the initial appointment lasted about two hours, and i left the office finally feeling as if i was on the right track, after months of mounting symptoms and growing concern about my health.  nothing about these diseases (lyme and other tick-borne diseases) is cheap or easy.  i've had to tap retirement, take out a second mortgage, cut back on expenses, rely on the generosity of friends and family.  but for me, it's been worth it.  the amount of informatiohn here is absolutely overwhelming, but the truth is, there's no need to even try and take it in all at once.  i think the guidelines published by dr. b are an excellent starting point and really define a solid treatment protocol for lyme. that said, lyme manifests differently in everyone, and treatment really does need to be individually tailored.  a good lyme doctor (llmd) can and will walk you through it all.  my suggesion would be to look at the menu on the left of this board to find a lyme group in your state. contact them to get a list of their recommended doctors. you can then ask people some questions here about any you might want to see.  this board is protective of all the lyme-literate doctors and doesn't ever post their full names...only initials.  go slowly; chances are you'll have the time to get to know a lot.  and again, welcome.  andie^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
doc j's hearing was very sobering. it was difficult watching this man be questioned regarding his impecable care practice of children shunned by the medical community. doc j was very composed, articulate and caring - as always.  there will be at least two more hearings --  i'm glad there is time to prepare between sessions.  everyone please remember to garner as many donations to the legal fund as possible!  doc j has a quality team but doc j is under fire and this is costing a great deal of money (medical review hearings are not covered by any kind of insurance) that's one way they try and break the knees of our llmd's - by way of the financial devastation these proceedings bring.  mo  -------------------- life shrinks and expands in proportion to one's courage -- anais nin^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

"wait---through whom do you get your insurance? you said blue cross, but who is the employer? is it a self funded plan? reason i ask is that there are some people in this system that do really care and will actually get you what you need. you have to know who you are looking for. you have to get through the first few layers of people and begin a relationship with an appeals specialist at blue cross or your employer.  sometimes calling the employer hr and talking with them about how the insurance co is denying this much needed treatment is enough to get you into the top ranks of folks that will be the ones to make decsions and make change for you.  for instance--in my case: my insurer was bcbs of new mexico. it was a self funded plan and my employer paid bcbs to administer the plan. so it was actually the employer that made the decisions about what is covered and what is not--especially in strange situations and not ""norm"" circumstances...like lyme iv treatment.  the employer was the school district but the plan was governed by the new mexico public schools insurance authority.  long story short: the deputy director is now working with me to get almost $10,000 of costs i paid for out of network surgery. the surgery date was august 2005...so this is 8 months later.  i appealed and squeeked and created such a paper load that bcbs ended up losing half my file and freaked out when i won a less expensive case i had brought to the attorney general. (this was for $70 that an ambulance co was wrongfully billing me for) i never once used a lawyer or paid for anything except my fax machine (which i love) and paper and phone calls.  they realised i knew my bussiness and that i wasnt going to back down and that it would cost more in legal fees than it would to pay for my $10,000.  i havent gotten the check yet, but negotiations are under way. the deputy director now calls me once a week to let me know how far they got and what the next step is.  you have to scratch your way to the top. the people who do not have any power will not allow your appeal to go thru and will not allow you to get what you need.  you might not fight right now---you may want to save your energy. but if i was you....i would document everything right now, and begin an appeals process and call them every single day. every single day. harrass them. it works. it might take months, but when they realise you wont go away, and your lyme wont go away either....then they might pay.  i just started a file and made sure i had time to call for about 30 minutes a day.  you said your hubby might be able to help? first thing: get the insurance issue of the lyme times and read it. and really understand it---it could really help you get thru this.  http://www.lymedisease.org/lymetime.htm  this is long, i am sorry. i think you can fight this b/c kentucky is not yet as hostile as places like ca---you might be able to get this thru!  i hope it helps you. take good care now, trails"^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
"hi saphire, insurance companies have really learned how to play the game so they dont have as much to pay. they are experts at avoiding at all costs the expense of getting us well. they use anything they can to do so as you are finding out.  even if you could find that person that said it was covered they would say upon review the made an error and they are not reponsible for errors and the real policy says""blah, blah blah"".  and their excuse for doing it is they say it is their responsibility to keep the claims low so it keeps the 'group' doesnt have high premiums.  dont know about yours, but my premiums are sky high and still no coverage. grrrrrrr, but thats about all you can do about it!!.  there are appeals you can do all the way up the chain. you should try it because it only takes one time to unload the burden of the last 30 days of iv's which is considerable i am sure.  probably 10k or best part thereof, by the time you add this and that and a bandaid or two in there.   same thing sorta for me. they covered the groshong central line, but doing that put me into another category of ""managed care"" thats whose job it is to cut you off and get you gone, no matter what!!  i read a first person account of a lady dr. whose job it was to deny people treatment, no matter what the reason, for a monetary bonus, and accolades from the insurance company.  she got a real nice bonus if the patient died!! no joke. so it is hard to fight that kind of system!!  in my opinion, thats who is feeding camp ""a"". for enough ammo to deny or contradict any sustained treatment!!  any body have any ideas how to blow there cover, or flush them out of hiding regarding the real money trail??  hope you find the way saphire, have you checked into needy meds free programs for your iv med???  wish i had met you at the float, missed it, darn!! admire the story i read here about you,you have come a long way!!! keep up the great work!! cause i am --just don--  -------------------- just don"^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

hi gang -- have done all that you say (before this).  erisa are federal laws that limit a law suit against self-insured plans, meaning those financed by an employer or union. these do not come under state laws. only federal. the insurer can only be help liable for the cost of the payments -- nothing more. i have been told, the inurer will fight with big guns to win even when the amount is small. if they win, i will not only loose the cost but also the cost of the legal fees. in this instance i will back out. i am trying to inform the entire union board and others about the lyme issue. i have multi-copies of lyme times about kids and about insurance which are being past around.  each of us needs to fight some how...  -------------------- mom & co.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

this is just my personal opinion, but i have a problem with this legislation.  i don't think the governement should be the ones to decide whether a person can or cannot afford health insurance and mandate that everyone at a certain income level must buy health insurance or pay $1000 a year in tax penalties. got that number from an article on this issue reported by yahoo.  i agree that the government needs to get more involved in premium issues and make quality insurance coverage afordable for people at all income levels. i just have a problem in taking away people's right to chose whether or not to be insured.  if you go to out of network doctors who are not covered by your policy that should be your choice. if you chose to pay everything out of pocket you should not be penalized on top of that when you already are paying out of your own pocket.  that's just my opinion.  hubby elected out of medicare for this very reason and continued his individual policy with bcbs and i elected to not carry insurance at all so we could afford his policy.  bea seibert^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

i have a pcp who is marginally knowledgeable. although she doesn't read up on the disease, she was willing to speak to my or my son's llmd, and when convinced of their logic, she had no trouble with prescribing tests or meds for us, so they were covered under our insurance.  in a way, i can't blame them. all those years of med school, and now all they want to treat is what they're trained to treat, not specialty stuff.  but perhaps you could look into having a lyme symposium for doctors in your area, and offering continuing education credit to your docs. ilads would have more information on how to go about that.  regards, shaz^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

di, azure wish is right. if your income and assets are low enough, then you qualify for medicaid, and your medicare premuims will be paid.  you don't have to get medicare as soon as you qualify, but if you don't they fine you by increasing the amount you have to pay by 1% per month that you don't sign up. unless you have a qualifying insurance through your work. i don't know if the bc you have now would qualify.  -------------------- sonoma county lyme support lymelinks@gmail.com^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

"hi chelsea-  my son had lyme, very badly for awhile and seems to be well now.  he had a bulls eye rash during the summer between 6th and 7th grade, no other symptoms at that point. he was treated for a month and seemed fine.  during the middle of 7th grade his english teacher called and told me that something was wrong with james, he just wasn't the same child or student as the beginning of the school year.  because of an insurance change we had to see a new doctor. this was before i knew about llmds. my belief that my son still had lyme was dismissed and his lack of attention in school was written off by the doctors as adolesence.  meanwhile i got very sick and believed i had lyme disease. i drove to another state for treatment. james was ok, not great in school, but ok. i was too sick to process the info well at all.  during 8th grade he totally crashed with respitory issues. he herxed while on abx for pneumonia! my light bulb finally went off and i took him out of state to my llmd, who immediately diagnosed him with lyme!  we found a llmd closer and begin serious long term oral abx treatment. 9th grade was a diaster. he herxed strongly, not being able to get out of bed for days and needing strong pain meds. he missed 50 days of school and was less than 100% most of the rest of the days. his 504 had ""time and flexibillity"" as accomadation. some teachers didn't comply giving him poor grades for failing to turn his work in on time. his test scores were pretty good, but the over all grades made him very sad and he begged to be home schooled.  so, home school we did during 10th grade, with the support of a cyber charter school. lyme brain teaching lyme brain, pretty scary at times! we got through it. james got to sleep twelve hours a day and complete his work. he still had trouble with deadlines and refusal to to honor the 504 for extra time.  his health improved a lot during 10th grade and he could go back to regular high school for 11th grade. i deal directly with the superintendent for his 504. james has study hall first and last period for a shorter day if needed.  james had a medication change last october and made major improvement in a short amount of time. his grades improved, he smiled again and after christmas and poor sleeping during january and february was able to do spring sports.  i still have to remind him and keep him focused to get work in on time. he is testing very highly now. he had very good sat scores and yesterday decided he would like to go to the prom! he looks forward to a ""normal"" year for 12th grade. he does have to make up one course from 10th grade next year.  i hope this is what you wanted chelsea. you can pm if you want other info. good luck with your project.  mel"^0^1^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
i need some help on info to send insurance company for info and lyme and treatment because obvioulsy they don't know anything about it!!  they said you don't have symptoms that coincide with lyme. (numbness/tingling, major brain fog, weakness, fatigue, forgetfullness, slurred speech, palpitations, left side numbness, joint pain, cold hands/feet) which most have gotten better with treatment.  also said all my tests have been negative so i don't have lyme. elisa negative of course and ignenex wb neg, but had some positive bands. am going to go off antibiotics and retest so i can get a positive result.  this just makes me sick. i just knew there was going to be a problem. do they think i would fake an illness so i could stay at home and be socially isolated? do they think i had a spinal tap for fun? i have never been sick in my life and used to run 20miles a week and was very healthy.  llmd already wrote them a letter which i guess didn't help. my short term will probably have to go into long term dis. so this is going to be a big problem financially.  i read treeparols links on disability, but if anyone has any advice please let me know. hopefully i am not the first person who has to deal with this.  this is all i need write now is extra stress.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
well - the first thing i'd do is teach them to read international peer reviewed medical works, other than their own. that would be helpful.  then i'd teach them how to do an appropriate long term medical study. that also would come in handy before proclaiming the non-existence of chronic infection. you'd think that'd be a critical process, wouldn't ya?  i'd ask them to actually proove long term treatment is ineffective -- also prudent before stating it is not.  then i'd ask them - what qualifications do you have to be making such determinations ??  the second thing i'd do is ask for records of all of their income, bonuses, contracts as case reviewers for insurance, or connections with large teaching universities - and eachother.  i'd ask them to recall some of their work decades ago -- and ask -- who odered the code red?  then i'd ask them to credibly diagnose a chronically ill patient with a difinitive lyme diagnosis in their history - who is still very ill.  --- 'throw away diseases' which have no cause, no basis in scienctific explaination - and no cure, just drugs for symptoms - don't count.  and i'd ask them how many patients with chronic lyme symptoms they had given a 'trash can' diagnosis to in their careers.  mo^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0

it takes some effort and you will have to learn the ropes, but it can be worthwhile fighting these ins decisions. don't give up too soon. that is what they are counting on. they know sick people usually just quit, because they don't want the fight.  the special issue on insurance printed in the lyme times can be gotten from calda. see newby links for contact info. gives a lot of good tips. also, you need to know your contract with the ins co. have you read it carefully?^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
we do not have out of network priviledges with this insurance plan. in january, we may be able to switch to a plan that he carries. however, some of the labwork he does is in his own private lab that he can't send to labcorp.  he did that on our first visit, being very respectful of the out of pocket cost. this time he gambled to have the insurance company pay it, but it was denied. this, of course, left me with a $1200 lab bill.  we are having to sell a car to pay it. i just wrote a letter to him asking him to please respect our situation and help us in the fight for our daughter's health, not burden us until we can't afford to treat her.  can he fire me as a patient for that request? i think it's reasonable. when i have to pay $200 a visit, then get sideswiped with that large of a bill, very few people can cover that.  i don't want to have to pay for his research.  it's just sickening, but they have you by the short hairs.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
thanks so much for the responses. seriously, i feel like i'm living in alternative word full of conspiracy haha. who knew that such a war was among us.  i stayed up last night and did a lot of research. i will not let them put any steroids in my back. i never really planned to as i just wanted to know what was wrong with me so that i could cover the bases in my mind. if anything i might take, motrin for the pain. that's ok right? either way, i know on top of whatever they find in there, i have lyme.  so last night i found a lab that works with igenex (true healt labs) and they have an igenex doctor order tethe st for you. i got the script to get a igenex western blot igg done and i paid 150 dollars out of pocket to do it. i know that testing at this point is almost silly but the only test that i've had done was mayo clinic and with my research, they seem like to worse one to go on.  i feel i owe it to myself to do this. i did not order the screening test (because i already tested positive) or wester blot igm test as at this point i've had the infection either my whole life or greated than 7 months. i figure that is the best bang for my buck and honestly i can't afford any other test right now. after this i don't plan on ordering any test for lyme as i know that i have it.... but i need to know all the bands that i have, strength of infections, etc. i have to know.  i plan on scheduling an appointment with a llmd as soon as possible and i don't plan on waiting. i do need to get testing for the other co-infections, i know. honestly, i read the symptoms of babesia and i got scared because it sounds so much like me. however, the tick that they found in my leg when pregnant was pcr tested for lyme, relapsing fever, babesiosis and anaplasmosis. it tested negative for these and only positive for lyme. but this, of course, doesn't rule out an unknown infection in childhood/ tick bite (which my blood test indicates).  i heard that llmd's don't take insurance-how is everyone able to afford the visits, meds, test ect??? i'm a licensed mental health counselor and make good money......geeez. i would like to be able to use my insurance for the co-infection testing at least! i don't want to start treatment for those if i don't have them so i do want to test.  i did get some decent llmd's from different places. of course if anyone has any recommendations, please let me know as i would be very grateful.  thanks so much for all of the support. seriously means the world to me right now.  -------------------- seeking assistance^0^1^1^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
excellent suggestions.  dr k and dr g too expensive.  my llmd will treat me for most of my concerns but at added cost.  my state has a new program that i can sign up for called health home services. it assigns a case manager, that oversees all your medical needs and coordinates communication between all of your providers.  it's goal is too reduce waste of duplicate testing and procedures to lower health costs. i don't believe this would be in my best interest as my conditions change rapidly and severely.  we really need an in-patient treatment center for tbi's covered by insurance companies !^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
lyme disease is just the tip of the iceberg for me.  secondary conditions are starting to pile up.  just diagnosised with diverticulosis. the pain is comparable to my i.c. bladder pain. almost made a trip to e.r. last night, but decided my body wouldn't be able to handle any more abuse.  add this to chronic sinusitis, vertigo, tinnititus, chronic pain and fatigue, ivig treatments, allergies, constant blood work, sweats, diarrhea, anxiety, insomnia, depersonalizations, mycoplasma, ect, ect, ect.  no further gains since may. only downward spiral.  i read success story threads but they are so old. trying to remain positive, i will get better. struggling again, whining again. so much suffering. so many people.  is there a specialty doctor that will look at my body as a whole individual ecosystem ? is there even such a thing ? do they take insurance ?^1^1^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
i'm in the northeast. i am not sure where you are, but there is a llmd in harvard, ma, who accepts insurance. you might want to consider making an appointment with her so that if it happens again, she can take care of it and you won't have to pay out of pocket. just as an aside, i had what i thought was a partially embedded tick in my arm a few weeks ago. i went to urgent care and the doc there didn't second guess removing it. it's been a mad year for ticks out here. i also went to an allergist recently who was very familiar with lyme disease and incensed by the status quo. you might find that doc's around here (of course, not all) are slowly coming around. especially when faced with one that's attached to you. let me know if you want the name of the llmd. i'd be happy to send it to you.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
my pcp dismissed it completely so i don't even know if she will sign off on it. llmd not covered by insurance. so it would be an expensive visit just to get him to sign off. i haven't had any symptoms. just found a tick in my bed. so haven't had a consultation yet.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
foxy, dr. h. gave a talk in april in which he mentioned many of the side effects that make it impossible for many people (1/3 of all patients) to take dapsone.  i took notes on this talk. here are the notes on dapsone:   treatment of lyme--dapsone  1:36:40 plaquenil hits the cyst form of lyme. serapeptase and neutramedix stevia hit biofilms.  1:38 using persister drugs�dapsone. 1:39 for a small percent of patients, you must pulse the dapsone to get rid of persisters. old tb persister drug (perizinimide) helped a patient with bartonella nodules on her hands (misdiagnosed as behcet�s). this drug goes inside the cells.  1:41:30 dapsone is used for leprosy, but it hits persisters and parasites and hits autoimmune illnesses. it gives a herx, so go slow!! or pulse it (25 mg every other day). work up to 100 mg.  it also causes anemia, can give rashes (it is a sulfa drug), and can cause methemoglobinemia (a blood disorder).  1:43:20 also, you can�t carry oxygen, so you can get blue hands and lips. so, consider dapsone if you have failed all other lyme drugs. it is very effective for neuro lyme symptoms.  if you failed all babs drugs, also consider it.  1:45:28 we don�t know the effective dose and the length of treatment necessary to completely eliminate persisters. the higher the dose of dapsone, the better. doxy, rifampin, and dapsone is most effective combo (using 3-4 intracellular drugs together)  1/3 of patients cannot take dapsone due to its side effects.  1:49 it does not affect your gut, so no candida concerns  1:50 summary: you must treat all 3 forms of lyme. his new book goes into dapsone treatment. they are doing a study so insurance will pay for treatment with dapsone.   all of my notes on this talk can be found at this thread:  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=136070;p=0  the numbers next to the notes tell you the exact minute and second on the video at which the subject is discussed.  so, to hear the full discussion of dapsone, just go to the video and advance it to 1 hour, 36 minutes, 40 seconds.  here is the video link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu0weofvm8^0^0^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
thanks keebler and lymetutu and grayaa,  my llmd is so knowledgable with tbi's, chronic illness, allergies, autism, detox, diet, supportive measures, testing, ect, ect. you name it, she knows it. i have the upmost respect and gratitude to be treated for this mess i find myself in.  but she 's so expensive $$$$$$$$$. but maybe not really, considering the terrain lyme presents. oh, how i wish insurance would cover our treatment. i know the success would come if i had proper care that money would provide.  i m still treating aggressively. llmd says i m covered in the event of another exposure. also said to avoid going outside.  added weight training and slowly coming out of the abyss. it's hard.  just thought someone could provide their experiences or opinion on what i came in contact with ? would love to figure it out by process of elimination. thanks again^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
how much is zithro/malarone after insurance.  my llmd told me that malarone is beter than mepron but you have to take right dose.  and it make sense because malarone has mepron on it and i think proguanil.^0^0^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
if i could go back, i wouldn't have put my body through those 2 months. i also wouldn't have wasted 2 months of insurance covered iv coverage for it.  it was not helpful for me. i am trying to get my potassium back where it is supposed to be. it was a nightmare for my particular body.  maybe others have success. i have now sworn off antibiotics because if it. and i was treated with 3 years of orals, bicillin, then 6 weeks iv rocephin previously.  you have to realize that you will be a guinea pig.^0^0^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
"contact as many lyme support groups near you as possible. see support groups on the left side of the page.  ask them who is getting people well in your area. tell them you want someone who follows the burrascano guidelines.  study the guidelines so that you are educated about these diseases and what good lyme treatment looks like. the guidelines are here:  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  there is no substitute for an educated patient when it comes to lyme. compare your treatment to what it says in the guidelines. we will help you to do it if you need help.  i wasted 2 years on a lousy treatment plan. that's why i stick around lymenet. i got rid of lyme and babesiosis and bartonella over 12 1/2 years ago. i am still symptom-free, enjoying my life.  i stay here to point folks to the good doctors and to the burrascano protocol. i got well when i went to a doc who followed burrascano. then, i sent at least 5 of my friends to docs who followed burrscano. they all got well also.  the burrascano protocol is the most successful protocol on the planet. burrascano was the lyme disease pioneer. he was the """"1 lyme doc when he was practicing. they came from every country in the world to be treated by him.  i don't know what area of the country you are in, so i can't say how far you might have to travel to get a good doc. many states have none. many people go out of state for treatment and many have to fly.  generally, lyme specialists do not take insurance. a lyme specialist is a doctor whose practice in 100% lyme disease or nearly so. it takes about 10 years of experience treating lyme for a doc to be able to handle most cases of lyme. so, ask folks how many years the doc has been a lyme specialist when you are asking around.  be willing to travel to get good treatment. the doc is the key to getting rid of this horrendous disease. can't emphasize that enough.  so, learn how to pick a good doctor. there is a real learning curve here. you can also ask in ""seeking a doctor"" forum for names of good ones in your area.  take advantage of the experience of those on this board. if you are on the east coast, you can write to me privately and i will tell you who the top docs are.  just click on the envelope icon above my post to write privately.  welcome to lymenet, anna! we will help you here all we can.  i don't know if you know it or not but there is no standard treatment for lyme disease. a lyme specialist is free to do what he wants. so, some use only herbs, some give very low doses of antibiotics for very long times (5 or more years, etc.), some follow the m protocol or the l protocol, some ""do their own thing"" (whatever they have discovered that seems to help people) and some follow burrascano.  for that reason, it pays to understand what protocol a lyme doctor believes in before going to him. this way, you know how your lyme will be treated.  here are a few points from dr. b's guidelines:  you must attack both the regular and cyst (or other) form of lyme simultaneously--requires at least 2 different antibiotics taken together to do so. see p. 14-16 for the antibiotics that treat lyme disease.  you must test the patient for all co-infections and other physical ailments (thyroid, etc.) and treat everything the person has.  you must treat all co-infections the patient has(including babesiosis, bartonella, ehrlichia, mycoplasma, etc.) or the patient will not get well.  you must use igenex (or other well-known ""reference laboratory"") for most of these tests--they are a tick-borne disease specialty lab in calif. (quest and labcorp are not ""reference laboratories."")  you must use very high doses of antibiotics to kill the diseases (batericidal doses).  you must give the patient supplements, probiotics, herbs such as artimesinin if babesiosis is suspected, and require adherence to rules such as low carb diet, no alcohol, no smoking, rest, and exercise as the patient is able to do it.  the required exercise is 1 continuous hour of weightlifting every other day. this restores the immune system to normal.  you must treat at least 2 months after all symptoms have disappeared (if sick at least 1 year).  these are just a few of the important points you will see in the guidelines. if possible, you want a doc who does everything burrascano says to do. he treated lyme for over 25 years, and compiled and published what he learned so that other docs could benefit from it."^0^1^1^1^1^0^1^1^1^0^0
- be sure to avoid any steroids as well as any biologics or anything to suppress immune function.  modulating immune function with ldn is different but that's not for everyone.  you still need to have specific antimicrobials for whatever tick-borne infections are on board. if infections are not addressed, nothing will work in the long run.  avoid all nsaids. better / safer ways to address inflammation & pain.  yet, whatever else you do or don't do, antioxidants can help reduce inflammation, pain & support liver (but most insurances never cover this approach).  you might be sure to get all the relevant books by stephen h. buhner as there is much that no md / no insurance is going to cover yet you can do on your own. -  [ 10-27-2017, 09:20 pm: message edited by: keebler ]^0^0^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
koo, it is true that insurance companies have been denying coverage of armourfor a while now. the insurance company i used for years gave me special permission based on my doctor's request and did pay for it. then i switched providers and was told i could file to have it covered as i had done with the previous company.  what they did not tell me is that according to their literature armour does not now fall into the category of drugs that one can apply for special permission to have per a doctor's request.  they claim it is exempted and cannot be requested by special permission. so one cannot ask for it be approved, so i am paying out of pocket now. from what i understand, little by little the synthroid lobby has made it impossible for people to get reimbursed for armour.  what your endo told you is not true. that is the old scare story they used to use that armour wasn't consistent in it's dosages from pill to pill and synthroid was better and it's been proven that it's the other way around.  i'm planning on calling my insurance company and others to see if any of them cover the other desiccated thyroid medications. some how i feel they probably don't.  here is a list of of thyroid meds and their ingredients. armour does not contain gluten but it contains other fillers i'd rather not have in my medication. one can even have it compounded so it does not have the fillers.  https://stopthethyroidmadness.com/armour-vs-other-brands/  np's are regulated on a state by state basis. in many states they cannot prescribe medications. in my state naturethroid is a prescription medication that requires a doctor's prescription and it's unlikely that it's much cheaper than armour though i'll looking into it soon.^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
"- koo:  as naturethroid - with 100 pills to the bottle - costs me less than $10 a month, i've never even tried to ask about insurance coverage. my nd gives me a discount but, still, it's very reasonable.  yes, it's a ""stable"" product - by all standards. every pill sure looks the same to me -- and their standards are professional, by all measure.  i think it is better than armour, in my experience, for my own body.  it's gluten free, too - and that is very important. i don't know if armour is. last time i checked, i preferred the source of their porcine hormone, too, and the treatment of the pigs.  still, any differences that might matter to you can be discussed with them:   http://rlclabs.com/  rlc labs   http://getrealthyroid.com/why-get-real/nature-throid/  nature-throid   http://www.pdr.net/full-prescribing-information/nature-throid?druglabelid=496  pdr - full prescribing information  nature-throid (thyroid) - rlc labs -"^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0
"often, when a person gets bitten and gets lyme, their immune system can handle the germ load from the bite. the immune system keeps the lyme in check, in other words.  then, years can go by and for some reason the immune system becomes weak. this could happen if you are in a car accident, have surgery, get very sick with some other illness, have a baby, take a lot of steroids (which suppress the immune system), get a second tick bite, go through a very stressful time including a death in the family, etc.  whenever the immune system is too weak to keep the lyme in check, then the lyme symptoms will begin to come out. if the immune system is weak for a long time, then the lyme symptoms will really blossom. so, this could be years after your original, non-eventful infection.  likewise, to get rid of lyme and not have it come back, you need to treat the infection and begin living a healthy lifestyle--no alcohol, no smoking, no steroids, no getting behind on sleep, taking supplements to replace what the lyme has depleted, and a certain form of exercise.  the exercise recommended by dr. burrascano is one continuous hour of weightlifting every other day. you do a full body workout each time--arms, chest, abs, back, butt, legs.  you do light weights and many repetitions so that you are able to do a full hour. first do arms for a number of minutes, then chest, then legs, etc. when legs get tired, go back to arms, etc. so that you can continue for the full hour.  my lyme doc told me that i would never get rid of lyme if i did not do this exercise. i began doing it even though my main lyme symptom for 10 years was extreme muscle weakness.  i could not stand for more than a minute or hold the phone to my head for more than 30 seconds. i could not hold my mouth open to have my teeth cleaned, i dreaded having to rise up from a chair or step up a curb.  nevertheless, i persevered. it took me months until i was able to lift weights for one continuous hour. i credit this exercise to the fact that when i completed my treatment over 12 years ago, i have never relapsed. i have the same life i had before lyme.  this exercise boosts your immune system! that is why it is essential for every lyme patient to do it. antibiotics alone will not do the trick. you must get your immune system back to normal.  lyme and babesiosis compromise the immune system just like aids. so, be sure to get good lyme treatment and be sure to strengthen your immune system so that you can eventually have a normal life again.  to read all about how this weightlifting works to strengthen your immune system, see page 31 and following in the burrascano lyme treatment guidelines found here:  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  ""lyme disease rehabilitation  despite antibiotic treatments, patients will not return to normal unless they exercise, so therefore an aggressive rehab program is absolutely necessary. it is a fact that a properly executed exercise program can actually go beyond the antibiotics in helping to clear the symptoms and to maintain a remission.""  i have not relapsed even though i got another bite 3 years after i completed my treatment. i only needed 30 days of treatment by my lyme doc to get rid of that new case of lyme.  i also endured terrible stress for a few years with no relapse, i also had steroid injections in my back and later oral steroids with no relapse.  so, just remember to keep your immune system strong and you will be able to keep lyme in check. we most likely always will have some lyme bacteria in our bodies, but our immune system will take care of it just like it controls viruses and other germs we have.  be sure to go to a doctor who treats like dr. burrascano, meaning with combinations of antibiotics at the dosages he recommends. and, be sure to treat all coinfections you may have. you will never get rid of lyme if you do not do these things."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
hi -  a friend's husband came down sick about a month ago and they are trying to figure out what he has. docs are stumped. did find some nerve damage. so many symptoms scream lyme.  but oddly, the only thing that makes him feel better is exercise. he mowed the lawn and actually felt good afterwards (then went downhill again after a while). the same thing happened after he ran on a treadmill for a stress test.  this is so opposite how i felt/feel with my own case of lyme and i've never heard of another lymie feeling great after exercise. has anyone experienced or heard of this? could this still be lyme?  if not, any other ideas? i was pretty convinced it was lyme until she told me this part about feeling great after exercise.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"exercise makes me feel really good most of the time. even when i'm having a really bad day, it makes my body feel better. even lifting weights a little bit makes a nice change. i like to mow the lawn too  my problem with exercise is that i absolutely must have sleep for my body to recover. the ""feeling good"" lasts for an hour or two afterwards. if i don't then go to bed i will crash like a rock. so physical activity for me must be done in the evening.  i do go through periods where any exercise is physically too much to handle even if i can force myself to get it started."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"- never rule out anything because one piece of the puzzle might look different.   ""so many symptoms scream lyme."" he's been ill for about a month. listen to that.  also, feels good with exercise ""afterwards (then went downhill again after a while).""  that's a big hint, actually. if that downhill happens later that day or the next day. the next day crash implies too much activity the day before. but you don't say when the ""afterwards downhill"" slide hits. still:  he needs to be properly assessed for lyme and for tbd / other possibilities. the crash later on is very classic. many report that earlier on exercise had made them feel better - for a while.  the endorphins from movement we enjoy or in accomplishing a physical task, too, can mask the truth for awhile.  it may be that the body is working with one on this, too, for a while - until it just can't anymore.  but with time and no diagnosis / treatment then that's more often when the exercise intolerance can talk stronger hold. some might have that very soon in; others later on.  and, once in a great while, there will be some who do well with exercise just as they might do with heat although most with lyme tend to have major problems with all this.  it's really important to never rule it out just because any one of the classic signs might be different than what most experience.  it might be wise to suggest that he not give up on physical movement yet to pace himself and be very wise about it not doing any aerobic stuff.  listen to his body - not what he wants to do but check in good with his body to get a sense on what might be wise and be mindful to ""read"" the body's signs when it's time to stop.  i pushed myself terribly and likely caused a lot of damage to my adrenal system - and injury from falls due to deep fatigue when i just pushed on (stupidly).  so often, because we might actually feel better & enjoy the sensory or social environment during some exercise we just don't get those signals from our bodies.  this happens a lot for those with lyme earlier on, too. it's not until the next day - or maybe a few hours later when it's clear the body just can't move or however that might manifest.  also advise him to not get overheated.  and, as you say ""so many symptoms scream lyme."" and he's been ill for a month and his doctors are perplexed, i hope he can be assessed by a good llmd. -"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"hi, geneal !!! i remember you.  i'm sure your doc will have you fixed up in no time. if you got well once, you can do it again. that is what i have seen.  my advice to you is to begin doing the burrascano exercise program. it is designed to boost your immune system and thus get it back to normal. once your immune system is again normal, you should not relapse anymore. it worked for me.  many people overlook this requirement of burrascano, but my lyme doc told me at my first appointment that it was essential that i do this exercise if i was ever to get rid of lyme.  it has now been over 12 years since i completed my treatment and i am still symptom free, enjoying my life. i have the same life i had before lyme disease.  and, in that 12 years, i have gone through unbelievable stress, the need to take steroids many times, (oral and epidural injections), and been bitten by another tick and got a bulls eye. (that required only 30 days of treatment by my lyme doc.)  still, with all of that, i have never relapsed. that is why i say that i am cured.  the necessary exercise is one continuous hour of weightlifting every other day. it must be a full body workout each time. that means you do arms, chest, abs, back, butt and legs each time.  you use light weights and do many repetitions. read about it in burrascano guidelines starting at about page 30 or 31.  i suffered from extreme muscle weakness when i had lyme, so this was very difficult for me to do. nevertheless, i persisted until i was able to do the full one hour.  if you are weak, just do the arm weights for as long as you can (5 minutes? 10 minutes?) then switch to legs. switch to different exercises until you have done all body parts. then, if you still have time, do it all over again.  you can use the bench press for chest, leg lifts on leg machines, crunches for abs, also leg machines that do buttocks. back exercises don't require any machines generally. find some on the internet and add them to your routine.  if you can't get to a gym, rig up what you can at home, even if it is just lifting soup cans, then heavier cans, set up a pulley for additional arm exercises, put ankle weights on your legs, etc.  if you remember sixgoofykids, she also credits the exercise for the fact that she has never relapsed.  ""lyme disease rehabilitation  despite antibiotic treatments, patients will not return to normal unless they exercise, so therefore an aggressive rehab program is absolutely necessary. it is a fact that a properly executed exercise program can actually go beyond the antibiotics in helping to clear the symptoms and to maintain a remission.  although the scientific basis for the benefits of exercises is not known, there are several reasonable theories....(p. 31)  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  let us know how it goes!"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
i suggest you do everything possible to strengthen your immune system. for example, the burrascano weightlifting program.  it is one continuous hour of weightlifting every other day. you use light weights and do many repetitions. you do a full body workout each time--arms, chest, abs, back, butt, and legs.  other things to strengthen it are eating raw garlic and getting proper nutrition (eat a good diet) and taking the supplements that burrascano recommends (magnesium, vitamin d, etc.)  also, don't do anything that weakens the immune system. for example: no smoking, no alcohol, no steroids or immune suppressing drugs, no skipping sleep, etc.  do everything in your power to strengthen your immune system. you will be amazed at how well the weightlifting works to do this. burrascano says it is essential and my lyme doc told me at my first appointment that it is essential.  read about it and why it works starting on page 31 of the burrascano guidelines.  work up to the full one hour if you cannot do one hour at the start. don't give up. persevere and you will have good results doing this kind of exercise.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
i had ample opportunities to get bit by ticks during a week-long camping trip in iowa in the summer of 2015. i also visited my folks in maine in the summer of 2015. my dad had lyme, but he is symptom-free now. i never got a rash.  i may have been infected by a dog bite that drew blood in august of 2015. the dog was a mean, mangy, junkyard dog in rural maine. the wound took a long time to heal. soon thereafter in the fall of 2015, i started seeing doctors for neck pain, numbness in my fingers and toes, pain radiating down my arms, and tinnitus.  before i started stephen buhner�s protocol, my major symptoms were light headedness, pain in back of neck, tinnitus, numbness and pain in my fingers and toes, headaches, strange sensations in my throat, fatigue, frequent urination, lower rib pain, early awakening, frequent napping late in the day, and pneumonia-like feelings in my chest wall with no shortness of breath. i think that my major symptoms were just beginning to flare on a four-week cycle, but i am not sure. . on rare occasions, i experienced cramping in my legs, pain in the soles of my feet, and strange tingling and stabbing sensations in various locations. on one occasion, my right eyelid inexplicably drooped.  i put myself on the buhner protocol. i also started taking supplements as recommended by burrascano. i significantly reduced my intake of sugar. i am very fortunate that i can engage in high intensity exercise.  i have been on this program for five weeks. my major symptoms are considerably reduced and some are gone altogether. as an aside, i have noticed that floaters in my eyes increased after i started the buhner protocol.  as of today, i will be in maine for one week, but i was unable to arrange an appointment with a lyme literate doctor. the doctors whom i contacted were all too busy. i also have family near baltimore, which could be a convenient base for visiting a doctor in maryland.  i can travel anywhere, but i have noticed that some doctors are enriching themselves treating lyme patients. it pisses me off that there are doctors who are taking advantage of desperate people. sorry for ranting.  thank you your help.

i don't know what way you should go, but if a person relapses, they really should cut out running marathons and running period. aerobic exercise is not your friend in that situation.  aerobic exercise weakens the immune system for over 24 hours.  it might be ok to do every once in a while if you are doing well, but as soon as you think that perhaps your immune system is not so good, i would cut it out totally.  and, please notice that the weightlifting has to be for one continuous hour.  and, it has to be a full body workout each time--arms, chest, back, abs, buttocks, and legs.  in all the years i have been on lymenet, i only know one other person besides myself who has come on here and said they did the exercise requirement.  so, based on that, i would have to disagree with you when you say you think many did the burrascano exercise requirement.  i know from being on lymenet for so many years that many drink, and often daily, even while in treatment.  so, that is where i am getting my data from--all my years on lymenet (i have been on lymenet for at least 11 years--you didn't have to register to send pms when i started on lymenet. in 2007 when they changed that, then i registered.)^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"thank you, jordana and catgirl, for your encouragement  i am not looking forward to cutting out all carbs (pretty much) again  it was so nice to be able to eat a piece of (gluten free) sweet food  tf, i am curious, if so few people actually do it, how do we know that the dr. b exercise prescription is the way to get well for everyone?  i am especially curious because this question has plagued me for years: in 2011 i stopped aerobics after reading his guidelines - i was not running anymore because of the pain in my joints  but i did the elliptical machine at the gym vigorously for 45 min at a time, with spurts of high intensity intertwined with low level but continuous effort  and i think i was better off for it, even though i had had lyme for over 12 years by then  i did notice that when i ""was good"" and made it to the gym every day some weeks, **that** actually hurt me and, to my surprise (back then) i felt weaker  now i see how that may have been immune suppressing  i did read up on dr. b's ideas - there are articles on olympic athletes who catch cold very easily because of a suppressed immune system from overtraining - so i stopped the aerobics  but i was always wondering if i had not done better if i had continued - it seemed to fit my body very well - just not every day, that was true for me, too  i wonder how dr. b determined that this program is right for everyone - probably few of his patients would keep it up - it is very strict and i found it boring myself- working with low weights and many reps does not appeal to me  kudos for you for keeping it up! so glad it helps you  -------------------- persistence, persistence, persistence!!!

"harmony, first you said that you thought many did the burrascano weightlifting requirement. now, you are saying that ""probably few of his patients would keep it up""--you found it boring.  you are allowed to increase the weights, just so you continue to do a full hour of lifting without stopping.  regarding how dr. b determined that this program is right for everyone, just read what he says on page 31, especially the part about scientific evidence that the t cell function is reduced by non-aerobic exercise for 12 to 24 hours and then rebounds. i take that word ""rebound"" to mean that the immune system then is better/stronger than before. and, that is how you finally get your immune system back to normal which is the goal.  it makes sense to me that weightlifting drives the antibiotics deeper into the tissues which would make the antibiotics more effective than they would be for a patient who does not exercise. when you are exercising an individual muscle during weightlifting, you are forcing more blood into that muscle to deliver more of everything to each cell of the muscle. the blood is carrying the antibiotics.  so, this exercise is enabling the antibiotics to get to spots in the muscles that they normally would not be able to reach (some areas have little bloodflow normally) or in greater quantities than normal, or both. all of this means that you are killing more lyme germs than normal.  by exercising every muscle group, you are ensuring this enhanced effect on every muscle you involve in the weightlifting--so a broad effect that is bound to make a difference. (less germs for the immune system to try to fight.)  all of the many possible ways this exercise helps the patient (listed on p. 31) make sense to me. not to you?  also read this quote from p. 3 which tells you the basis for everything in his guidelines:  ""information included here is based on the literature, presentations at scientific meetings, the many valuable observations noted by my colleagues, plus experience from caring for my own patients.""  burrascano is absolutely positive that this exercise needs to be done to get into remission. see how he states it here:  ""despite antibiotic treatments, patients will not return to normal unless they exercise, so therefore an aggressive rehab program is absolutely necessary. it is a fact that a properly executed exercise program can actually go beyond the antibiotics in helping to clear the symptoms and to maintain a remission.""  so, note that he says this is a fact. and, he calls it ""absolutely necessary."" these statements tell you how sure burrascano is that every lyme patient needs to do this.  my lyme doc who cured me told me emphatically at the first appointment that i would not get well if i did not do the exercise requirement.  so, he was also evidently convinced that it is required to get this disease into remission.  don't you think you should be willing to do something boring 1 hour every other day in order to try to get rid of this disease?  the diet is restrictive. i didn't like that, but i did it because i saw that it truly did prevent yeast overgrowth.  when i was sick with lyme (it stole almost 10 years of my life), i was willing to do anything to get rid of it.  burrascano treated so many patients for lyme and was the most successful doctor on the planet. so, that should give you confidence that what he requires you to do is likely correct.  sixgoofykids did pilates instead of weightlifting. she also credits this exercise for the fact that she got rid of these diseases and has never relapsed. she wrote that in a thread a few years back when i was saying that i believed that few people took this requirement seriously and, therefore, few stayed in remission or were cured like me. she was very emphatic about it. she said she completely agreed with me.  pilates also involves all muscles of the body being required to bear weight or strain against resistance. so, evidently it fulfills the same requirements as weightlifting.  in my life, i have proven to myself twice how well this weightlifting works. for me, it was almost like a miracle. so, i have no doubt about it."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
water, only water, and a good amount of it. it is counterintuitive to drink more water, but it helps.  gluten and casein free diet.  30 minutes of pelvic floor exercises daily is imperative. i didn't notice anything for many months, then it hit me and was a huge help. to this day, i can tell if i slack off on pelvic floor exercises too long bc ic symptoms flare.  my pelvic therapist said i was one of the worst cases she had ever seen and only told me this after i started making marked progress that she had doubted i would ever get better. ic is now the least of my worries.  best wishes.

"yes, you could have taxed your immune system with running to the point that it could no longer keep the lyme in check.  did you have any surgeries or medical procedures or illnesses that could have caused this? or stress, or steroids or another bite? (sometimes you get steroids as part of a colonoscopy, for example, and you don't even know it.)  if you only managed to keep lyme symptoms away by taking herbs, then you really never fully recovered from lyme and coinfections. you have been treating yourself for these infections continuously to the present.  the fact that you relapsed when you had your daughter tells you the condition of your immune system. it is not yet strong.  rather than running (aerobic exercise), burrascano says to do one continuous hour of weightlifting (a full body workout each time--working all muscle groups) every other day.  this strengthens the immune system so that you will no longer relapse. see this quote:  ""lyme disease rehabilitation  despite antibiotic treatments, patients will not return to normal unless they exercise, so therefore an aggressive rehab program is absolutely necessary. it is a fact that a properly executed exercise program can actually go beyond the antibiotics in helping to clear the symptoms and to maintain a remission."" (p. 31)  he goes on to say over and over that aerobic exercise is not permitted except for a very brief warm-up prior to doing non-aerobic activity such as weightlifting.  it worked so well for me that i completed my treatment over 10 years ago and never relapsed--not when i herniated a disc and had to get some epidural injections (steroids), not when i went through an extremely stressful time, not when i had sinus surgery, not when i took oral steroids for at least a month for a sinus problem, never.  my lyme doctor who cured me followed burrascano totally. he told me at my very first appointment that i would never get well unless i began doing the burrascano exercise program.  burrascano explains that aerobic exercise is not allowed as it lowers the immune system for too long a time (well over 24 hours).  perhaps once you get into a full remission (where you don't need herbs or anything to remain symptom-free) and after about a year of that, then you could occasionally do some aerobic exercise like running and see how you do.  right now, i would say to cut out aerobic exercise totally. it is not your friend.  if you are drinking or smoking, those weaken the immune system also. so does eating sugar such as in sodas. (a soda with sugar lowers your immune system for 4 hours.) so, don't do anything that weakens the immune system and do everything that strengthens it (garlic, the weightlifting, good diet, a full night's sleep every night, etc.)  keep up the weightlifting once you no longer need herbs. and, i would recommend no heavy drinking for the rest of your life and no smoking for the rest of your life.  wait for about a year after you are completely in remission before you have occasional alcoholic drinks.  i got another tick bite 3 years after i completed my treatment, and i only had to take antibiotics for 30 days to treat that case of lyme. i had the bulls eye, and i had a mild herx the 3rd day on antibiotics, so it was clearly another case of lyme.  you will have to judge how strong your immune system is by giving it small tests in the future and then go by the results of those tests. everyone is different.  i don't drink or smoke and i don't drink sweet drinks at all (and no artificial sweeteners either), so that probably contributes to the fact that i have never relapsed in over 10 years. i still try to lift weights once or twice per week also.  so, don't be discouraged. learn to love weightlifting. you will certainly love the benefits of it--you will have nice muscles in arms, etc., you will notice that you are stronger when it comes to carrying groceries or heavy objects, doing things that require strength (like scrubbing down your aluminum siding on your house) and you will look conditioned all over your body. no more flab or fat.  i hope you can figure out what set you back and eliminate that thing for now."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
jordana,  another thought about why sometimes you experience horrific pain on t and sometimes you don't.  something similar happened to me concerning t. over time i realized that the days i worked out (resistance exercises including shoulder shrugs with weights), when i was on a regimen with t, the next day i would be in terrific pain in the back of my neck and top of the shoulders. this does not happen when i'm not on a regimen of t.  are you working out, exercising or doing some sort of lifting weight the day before the terrible pain starts?  well, just a shot.  in the meantime, i see you're smiling, so keep it up. and let everything be well (as can be).  still winning^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
- as this thread has developed into a nice collection of information (i hope), here's an very important account from brussels who wrote this is a similar thread:  brussels writes on 7-22-12:  mjoey had post exertional malaise so it was hard to exercise. lyme was not an issue for him anymore after the bionic treatment, i suppose.  he continued to have cfs but no longer lyme.  i had a problem with physical exercises, i couldn't exercise for lack of energy... i could barely stand up and take a shower, so how could i think about exercising?  i got better almost without any exercise program. i love walking though, so i think i only kept moving only after i had the energy for that, but never did any systematic training.  when i finally got well, i could swim and cycle up and downhill again... but that was after lyme was gone.  i guess each case is a case... of course if i could, i would have done something, but i could barely make any mental calculation of 2 + 3 = 5 as it consumed too much energy, couldn't concentrate to cook more than one dish the whole day as i kept forgetting what are the steps, one after another.  it was total lack of energy in my case. so nope, exercise was not for me during the worst months... only later, when i got slowly better.

i'm reviving this thread again because this problem continues with me.  i don't treat anymore. i feel pretty well. i still eat clean for the most part and continue with supplements and herbs. i do take an adaptogen for adrenal support.  i have been exercising quite well for over a year. nothing cardio but pilates and yoga. i've done very well with this and wanted to take it up a notch.  i started pilates reformer personal training where exercises are more intense and call for more strength. i can do them fine. however, well afterward i notice an increased heart rate for quite a well....in the 80 range which is too high for me. it comes down after a few hours but i still get that feeling of inflammation behind the sternum. i don't think it's costochondritis because it is always in the same spot behind my sternum and never involves the rest of the ribs.  when i had active lyme that discomfort was there all the time. it went away with treatment but does come back with too much exertion. it happened a few weeks ago when i attempted to play pickle ball. i played for about 45 minutes and i could tell while i was playing that the pain was going to happen afterward. it never happens during exercise.  i do take acetyl l-carnitine and have taken l-cysteine for mitochondrial support as well as co-q 10 but it never makes a difference. am i missing something?  the pain goes away in 1-3 days. today i drank 1/2 tsp salt in lemon water and that sometimes help. i don't get the malaise.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

(i have never really exercised) i could not do crutches... and my balance and strength was so bad, i had a really hard time getting around with the boot.  the good thing that came out of it was the physical therapist took me under her wing... after my ankle healed, i gave her dr. b's guidelines... and we worked with weights a bit... but i really wanted to be able to walk better. so in january she started me on the treadmill. i started out at 6 minutes and 1 mile an hour. i did this every other day during the week adding either 30 seconds or speed each time... there were days i hurt like hell and was tired and she would have me back off... it was really hard at first (pathetically, i mean 6 minutes) but eventually, i started getting a bit more energy. and i realized, i didn't hurt any more than usual!  i am now up to a mile in 24 minutes. (still pathetic i know... but good for me) if i go through a flare, and i'm hurting i back off and go slower... and for the first time in my life i am seeing the positives of doing it. i panic a bit if i miss a day. but if i try to do too much more time or speed... i am out of it for days...  my inflammation numbers have gone down. my killer t cells have gone up... and when i'm feeling well, i feel much better than i ever have.  but when i feel bad, it is very hard, but i still try to do it for fear of losing ground. in april, when i had a major flare or re-infection, i had to slow way down and just got back up to the mile.  so slow. slow. slow. even if you feel like you can do more when you're actually doing it... don't. build up really slow! good luck!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
this is a great discussion - thanks everyone for your comments.  here's what i'm dealing with:  when my gut is working, i can do resistance exercises (i.e., weights) daily and increase every 3-4 days fine. i find if i don't do the exercises daily, i can not increase ever...just don't seem maintain gains on the alternate day thing...  after a year or so of great exercising like this, my gut started to slow down and i started getting more and more tired after doing my exercises. so i slowed down on the exercises but kept doing them.  when my stomach crashed (could it have something to do with the mitochondrial thing, or adrenal insufficiency, or some other issue? i simply do not know), i could barely get out of bed. i had absolutely no energy for anything.  here it is a year later, and i'm still dealing with having no energy for anything. walking across the room wears me out.  leaving the house for a doctor appointment exhausts me for the rest of the day and all the next day (or longer, depending on how much energy i spent while away from home).  it's all so frustrating to get to where i feel like i'm making some really good progress on strength and stamina, and then all of a sudden i crash and can't do a thing.  -------------------- -razzle lyme igm igenex pos. 18+++, 23-25+, 30++, 31+, 34++, 39 ind, 83-93 ind; igg igenex neg. 30+, 39 ind; mayo/cdc pos. igm 23+, 39+; igg mayo/cdc neg. band 41+; bart.

i have managed to get rid of my insomnia but not my fatigue, with antibiotic treatment.  i just take melatonin to help me fall asleep now and it works well for me.  i get really tired in the afternoons - adrenal fatigue, but ashwagandha helps me alot.  i have just started taking it again because i had a relapse in my fatigue symptoms after a very stressful few months.  exercise can help with both insomnia and fatigue. are you able to exercise at all?  i walk for 30 minutes on a treadmill several days a week and it helps.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
yes, i can exercise! i just started a few weeks ago and am amazed at what i can do. (i have been rebounding for awhile, but now real exercise.)  i got sick with a cold/fever and have missed two wks of exercising and i had only been exercising 3 wks. bah!  i guess i am going to have to try the lesser strength kavinace. which is too bad since my llmd sells sups at a greatly reduced price.  i would be interested in how you healed your adrenals, too, 6goofykids. i guess i should start taking my himalayan salt again.  not treated candida. how do you do that, lymetoo?  -------------------- j_liz^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

i've been trying to stay active and also get back into weight training...but weight training feels the worst. it's like every tendon in my body gets sore with weight training (a sore that i otherwise don't seem to get). why is that? it's not like my body isn't conditioned for weight training - before suffering through all this lyme stuff, i was a long term weight lifter/personal trainer who could easily do a number of exercises using the equivalent of my body weight or more. then all the sudden, it's like a switch was flipped and this awful tendon pain from weight lifting started.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
fitness there are very sspecifuc reasons that is happening. you need to educate yourself on it cuz the wrong type of ex at the wrong time can hurt you and set you back on healing  i dont have much time today but it is ok to ask about correct exercise during treatment on medical board  i might go start a thread for you there  there is a sticky on top of medical i think that has dr burrascanos guidelines. in there he has a section on ex and pt...very specufic  one if mods sixgoofykids knows a lot and has a pilates school  i was a pe and adapted pe teacher and rode and showed horses for 50 years...now taking a shower can be counted as exercise fir me  everyone isnt like that...i had lyme 15 years before i could get tx. one ofvmy sons had tx over ten times when a teenager and now he competes in braziluan jujitsu and does really well...thats a ruff sport  a few years ago i was riding 3 x a week and kayaking whenever i could  ak on here. climbed a mountain in alaska a few years ago...hiker and lymetoo are really good about increasung their walking  kam and i count showers and washing dishes as exercise until we can get back in the gym...or on the horse!  so please make sure to find out what might hurt you and then keep coming back and tell us how you are doing  welcome!  -------------------- lyme? its complicated. educate yourself.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

"peimomma--it is my dream to run again although i would settle for fast walking without my trekking poles. i am glad you are on your way to wellness.  today i did about 40 minutes of exercise--a little on the exercise bike and the rest walking.  i am glad i had my trekking poles, because i had to really ""hoof it"" to beat the rain. i think this is the summer of rain for the midwest.  am feeling very toxic from the violet wand use on monday. i think i should not have upped the power from low to medium--lol.  i did go to the new hy-vee grocery store. they have a lot of organic and gluten free products. the store is so huge it is overwhelming.  pretty expensive, too, and very crowded. you all can laugh when i tell you the only things i  bought were a bottle of champagne on sale for mom's b-day in august and some dairy free coconut milk ice cream bars for a treat.  time to read a little and then bible study at church tonight.  -------------------- hiker53  ""god is light. in him there is no darkness."" 1john 1:5"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
thanks!! not well yet but on the road for sure and only found my exercise freedom since may. january 2015 and before i was much like many of you, a load of laundry was a good day with vacuuming the downstairs.  every time i tried to work in exercise i would end up on my backside for a week with a migraine and my pain would really be bad.  i started using mhbot 1 february and have slowly been able to add in exercise. i started with a goal of 10,000 steps a day m-f in may and half way through the month i added light yoga. that was going so well this month i added light weight training to the mix.  not well enough to work yet but i'm thinking by next spring i should be ready. i've found that after years of inactivity my body really suffers from endurance and stamina. baby steps building this body back where it came from the last 20 years.  so far we've done more motorcycle riding this year then i was able to do all of last year. i hope to go on an overnight trip in august, we'll see how i'm doing in the heat.  i turned 46 this year and never thought i'd run or ride a bike again but i have done both in the last month so keep the faith my exercising friends?????^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
first time post to this thread.  yesterday i mowed our yard, walked 30 minutes on the treadmill, 2 loads of laundry and 45 minutes of beginners yoga.  today i walked 30 minutes, 30 minutes of light weights and gave my male dog a bath. oh and marinaded steak and made salsa for dinner tonight?  i've enjoyed reading all that everyone does each week. i hope to buy a bike in the near future to add that in to my exercise routine.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
friday-me and mom worked out at cardio rehab. they amped up her routine a little so she was tired when finished.  my routine was cybex 750at for 20 minutes same level as yesterday. star trac treadmill for 15 minutes and varied speed between 2-3 mph. oh also did the ten minute cardio program warm up.  so far no exercise fatigue/intolerance that i was experiencing for at least 1-2 years. that really surprises me. i've been expecting it to hit me and it hasn't yet. wonder if it has something to do with my mcas treatment?  tutu-i can't imagine going to more than one show. i would burn out from too much excitement and sensory overload. my cheeks were sore from too much smiling at the jazz place. nothing beats live entertainment!  hiker-wait til i start working again and we'll see if i can keep it up! i'm thinking about starting soon (part time) since my mom's health and my own are much improved. btw, josh ordered a nordic track treadmill (darn cyber monday) so hopefully we can try to motivate each other.  kayak-well hello stranger! i'm glad too that you posted! i see that you're keeping yourself and etta fighting trim! lol!  it's so funny...i had the pot roast dinner at cracker barrel wednesday. it was really good and the best part was no work required!  see you guys tomorrow!    -------------------- do not take this as medical advice. this comment is based on opinion and personal experience only.  alaska lone wolf^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

"james, i did look into the exercise-mood relationship some before, long before i knew about lyme, because i had horrible insomnia and the regular docs were going to put me on ssris (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) and i refused -  learned that you can ""make serotonin"" on the treadmill and off to the gym i went and it worked - i slept better and got more energy and more positive, like you commented  ssris are not for me, as i think the body reduces serotonin production even more if ssris are taken orally and if you ever try to get back off the drugs, you crash really hard... not something i was going to risk  especially given the delicate balance i had established with my system given all the other problems i had already  where is the thread on the dr b ex recom?? could you point me to it please??  -------------------- persistence, persistence, persistence!!!

just checking in-no real exercise news. i have gotten 2 really good nites sleep so that is good. i'm gonna slowly continue to unpack so i have lots of totes to take back. i sure hope next trip is the last.  i'm supposed to cook just a turkey breast and the minimum of fixins for my 2 oldest and their wives. the wives might help a little. one is bringing yams...theres noway i can wrestle a turkey anymore with my hands. and they are at the worst they have ever been with this move. last nite i couldnt type or even push the microwave buttons...  theres a bunch of emotional stuff going on with both couples so i sure hope it goes ok. all 4 of my kids have stuff going on now. ususally i can brag about how good they are doing. when i realized how they are all struggling now i got kinda overwhelmed and i just had to let it all go. i sure cant fix it. i did my job...now i'll just sit back and watch it unfold.  i'm just gonna try to enjoy any little time i have with them...i see them so rarely...and focus on taking care of me.  i figured out how to put a chair in each room so i can sit and have a good view of the mountains...i didnt do that before. i like it.  there really is too much stuff here and i wish i could give that treadmill to one of you who need it. maybe i'll start a new post...maybe there is someone closer who could use it.  have good days everyone!  -------------------- lyme? its complicated. educate yourself.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

if you have not yet done so, i strongly suggest you read the burrascano lyme treatment guidelines found here:  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  they will give you an education on this disease.  at page 31, he explains that a lyme patient must not do aerobic exercise, only non-aerobic.  you need to start doing weightlifting. work up to a continuous one hour full-body routine every other day. this is essential to boost your immune system. that is the only way you will ever overcome lyme.  aerobic exercise lowers your immune system for too long. so, it is not allowed. so, swimming and walking are out.  welcome to lymenet! you can learn a lot here. educate yourself, and you will do well. we will help you here all we can.  the burrascano lyme treatment protocol is used all over the world. it consists of 4 prongs:  antibiotics supplements anti-yeast diet exercise as specified above  i got rid of lyme, babesiosis, and bartonella by going to a doctor who followed this protocol.  if your essential oils substitute for the antibiotics, then just add the other 3 prongs and see how far you can get. sounds like you have really made progress.  good for you!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"oh don...that sounds awful. i missed what happened. i guess thru my whole ordeal this last 3 months i should have been really thankful the left knee was worse than the right. i did drive. it was mostly ok...i had to borrow my son's stick shift the night i took kris to the vet and there were some close calls then...but i was able to go where i wanted...beach or shopping...even tho it was hard to move around when i got there...and i could graze just fine...almost 10 pounds worth...  i'm wondering tho if you can do some lying down exercises...all kinds of crunches and leg raises and what about some weights for upper bod while you're sitting? the more muscle you mske the more calories you can eat without gaining!  but i missed how you got hurt so imay be way off base  its beautiful here today. its snowing everywhere i would go to visit for thanksgiving tho so i am planning to cook a small turkey dinner...i think a friend might stop over later-they have to work thanksgivng morning. today-i'm waking up slow letting the meds kick in and baking frozen pies and cutting up some veggies...i really should buy the pre cut ones with these hands but they just taste old to me.  i'm gonna bundle up and go snuggle into a sand dune this afternoon-its so sunny...get some vit d-listen to waves smell the salt. i'm greatful for being close enough to do that...in nh i couldn't.  i'm watching the weather and as soon as there are 3 days in ithaca ny without snow i'm gonna go visit my two aunts...one is 88 one is 94 and they have trouble getting around but their minds are still sharp as tacks.  i know when you are going thru a hard time(kris) the best thing to do is try to do something nice for soomeone going thru a harder time...and they are all excited about me coming.  and about kris...you guys...iknow i'm not crazy...hope writing this doesn't make someone come here and lock me up...but every single day since kris went to sleep i have heard his tags jingling at least once. i know it may just be my messed up lyme brain. i have smelling hallusiations occasionally too and have for years. the first 3 times i just tried to ignor the jingling. then sunday morning i was woken up with a real loud sharp bark...the kind he would give to say ""cmon ma..get me up...caryy me out...its morning!!!""  honest...it was so loud i jumped up(well-sorta jumped) and i knew he was gone but i looked out windows seeing if there was a stray around. and then i got a good feeling that he was telling me to stop feeling guilty...i had done the right thing...he was painfree and playing with his brother...and i felt pretty good for a few days.  but then yesterday i heard the jingle again and this morning another bark woke me up. and now i'm thinking hes confused and stuck here . this morning it was three barks in a row...reallly urgent...like c'mon...its past time for our walk...  so...i could be crazy..(i'm not-really) or it could be my lyme brain(don't forget the two head injuries) or i'm thinking maybe i need to hook up with that lady on tv that helps ppl ""cross over"" whatdaya think?  i may regret posting this and delete it soon...don't call the crazy police on me.  -------------------- lyme? its complicated. educate yourself"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
for the first time in 10 months, i can run again! it may only be for 15 mins, but i never thought i could again. i am turning 21, and i have only had lyme for a year, but just recently started long term antibiotic treatment this last may. i have chronic lyme, but things are starting to look up.  it took a lot of patience, but my llnd okayed me to exercise 3 to 5 times a week as of two weeks ago.  i honestly thought i would be in pain, and be in pain 3 days after words.... i was not going to attempt it. i kept telling myself that i wouldnt be able to do it.  after my husband went to work, i went to the gym and got on the treadmill, and start with a jog and was shocked, and then began to run.  i felt like crying because i was so happy!  and i felt great after the run, and felt no pain afterwards ;-)  thank goodness for long term antibiotic treatment!!!  its nice to  -------------------- stephanie, university student.  ehrlichia [positive] igg/igm ab [h] 1.49 indexlyme ab interp. eia [a] positive igg p93 ab [present] igg p41 ab [present] igm p41 ab [present] igm p23 ab [present] lyme igm wb interp.

i've been weight lifting for mass for years. protein is the building blocks of muscle, so yes you're increased protein intake can cause your muscles to grow with a proper exercise routine.  generally if you weren't physically active and then start to work out you will loose weight as you burn fat, you'll then start to gain as you build muscle.  as stated above carbs are also essential for mass, many body builders have a high protein, high carb diet to bulk. if you cut carbs and increase protein this is basically the atkins diet, you probably are getting cut and not bulk. as you cut your muscles become more defined, but you stay the same size or even get smaller. you just have the illusion of looking bigger due to the muscle definition.  if you cut carbs and increased protein, but never really worked out before there's a good chance that you are getting bigger and getting cut. you won't look like the hulk without the carbs though.  either way, no matter what your goal, take pride in looking and feeling better. i've been at it for over a decade, any time i take a break for a month or two i can't wait to get back into it.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

did my third day on the treadmill today. started the first two days very gently and only for 15 minutes. today i did a half hour with a bit more intensity.  after the treadmill, i do some gentle floor exercises, such as pushups, squats, and crunches.  feeling pretty good, although my left leg has been doing some strange nerve-pain stuff but i think it's finally working itself out.  this sudden burst of physical activity came about because i weighed myself 4 days ago and to my horror, i've gained 10 lbs. in about two months.  i was so mad at myself when i saw this that i actually started talking to myself, swearing and calling myself names.  anyway, i'm going to try to stick to the 30 minutes of treadmill every day, even if i don't feel like it. i'm also going to maybe add some light weight lifting to the couple of floor exercises i do.  now if i can only keep this mindset and my body doesn't give out on me...  kam, i second what lymetoo said....don't overdue it! it's amazing to me how much you've been accomplishing and improving in the past couple of weeks.  aklnwlf, you go easy too!   happy saturday to everyone.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"lot's of good advice from those that know.  regarding vestibular therapy, you might find one if you can find a neurotologist in your area.  they ( neurot's) often refer patients for this therapy since so many of their patients suffer with dizziness and vertigo.  if you can't find one of those ( very specialized and not that many), then call a rehab center where they work with stroke patients.  there are sites on line too that give exercises you can work on at home.  it can be as simple as standing beside a wall on one leg and holding it for a few seconds then switching to the other leg.  i use a swiss ball for many of my balance exercises.  if i am standing in line at the grocery, i practice by balancing on one leg and just barely holding the other foot off the ground ( so i don't look totally crazy  i have 2 big dogs and looking back, they are what's kept me going every day. i must get outside, i must walk them and there have been days when it's a really slow walk.  i have had too many falls while out and now the residual effects like a shredded rotator cuff plus many other additional aches from the trauma of falling.  to protect your eyes which interact with your ears to keep you balanced, try this:  wear a large brimmed hat and sunglasses to help deflect any additional stimulus.  you can pick up soft foam ear plugs to protect your ears from loud noises.  they even have some that are on a cord so when you don't need them, they dangle from behind your neck and don't get lost.  if you don't challenge your vestibular system if will become weak. make it work for you everyday, somehow. that's whats nice about the swiss ball, i am already close to the floor, so at worse, i will roll off and not do any damage.  i also have a trainer who has worked with me for a few months. we concentrate on balance but also in conditioning as i had lost much muscle from inactivity.  our muscles and a strong core will help us remain upright. you have 3 parts to your vestibular system: ears, eyes and feet.  every time your heart beats, your eyes adjust to keep you balanced. it's a very big job, keeping the balance which is why you must work your system to make it stronger.  yes, it takes time and patience but you must fight to keep yours working in peek performance.  magnesium: it comes in many forms and dosages. i was severely deficient and needed iv's for a couple of weeks to build up before i could start oral supplementation.  the iv is called a myer's cocktail. it does sting but that's the magnesium and it's all over quickly. at that time, i had horrible headaches. as soon as i took an iv, the headache immediately went away, wonderful side effect!  actually, it's not a side effect at all, it's another treatment for migraines.  magnesium glycinate is easier on the system and i used it for years 800mg every day. now i take magnesium malate, still 800mg per day.  you could also take a bath with epsom salts at night before bed, your skin is your biggest organ and will absorb magnesium. this also helps you sleep and we all need more of that as we can't heal with poor sleep. sleep cycles are when the body does most of the repair.  while you are in treatment, you probably should pay attention to your liver since it has to process all your normal/daily stuff like food but now it will have a higher toxin load and the chemicals from the drugs you are taking.  your liver needs support! milk thistle and glutathione. taking it as a oral supplement might not be the best delivery system. it was recommended for me to take it in an inhaled form using a nebulizer...just something to look into.  i take a liver detox supplement everyday and my liver is showing much improvement plus i am eliminating more toxins.  i picked up a swiss ball at marshall""s for 10.00, just an fyi.  keep a note on your calendar of what you accomplished each day. visuals are powerful reinforcements. remind yourself ""i can"" and then do whatever, but do something. it could be that you took out the trash or you walked outside in your yard but do something everyday. some days are hard, so you do less. i just don't want you to fall into becoming your illness.  you are still you, don't forget that.  it's very easy to slip down the slippery slope of chronic illness and end up in depression.  best wishes on your journey!"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

i don't do much. i ride a stationary bike for about 40-60mins at a moderate pace. it's not really hard except for that last 10-20 mins, then it gets tiring.  i don't exercise my upper body and i don't stretch. those two things never helped me since i tighten right back up about 5-10 mins after i cool down. also, strength training doesn't seem to help much either. i get stronger, but at the expense of feeling like **** while doing the training. plus it just pumps my cortisol levels up.  lighter weights is probably equal to what i already do when washing dishes, or washing myself, and picking up things by hand during the day.  i would really like a much better routine but i'm just not ready for more than the bare minimum, so i stick with the stationary bike.  -------------------- i am not a physician, so do your own research to confirm any ideas given and then speak with a health care provider you trust.  e-mail: sbauzys@comcast.net^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"hello everyone....really enjoyed just reading everyone's updates! so uplifting! wonderful tips on keeping cool, too!  i need some help on modulating exercise. who woulda thunk it? i used to post on this thread about walking a mile here and there; then it had been so long that i've been bedridden and unable to do a thing, i haven't posted in forever.  but now i have a pool, and i've started swimming. and i've been so busy swimming i didn't come and post it every day, lol!!! i was going to....but i kept track of it in my lyme log. (www.lymelog.com.) anyway...now i am having trouble having any clue about modulating it.  i have clearly missed days due to bad weather and when i feel horrible. but i just swam a streak of five consecutive days, about 20 minutes a day of nonstop swimming, and i am in agony. here's what i wrote in my lyme log last night:  ""i really overdid it with swimming. today i felt very tired, but i forced myself to swim anyway. when i first started my arms and legs felt like lead weights and i was very out of breath. as i kept going it got a little better, but i had to take breaks in between; compared to the last few days where i have breezed right through it.  then when i went to bed, late at night the pain set in. it was awful; my joints hurt horribly! it was very painful but my legs also felt restless; very hard to describe, like i needed to move them but if i moved them at all they hurt like hell. i took 800 mg of ibuprophen, which i am not supposed to take being on coumadin. that did nothing. after suffering for a couple hours i broke down and took 2 vicodin which finally took the pain away.  a while later i was still aching all over though my joints felt better so i took 10 mg of valium which is prescribed for muscle pain though i very rarely take it. what a painful night, all in all. i need to learn how to modulate myself with exercise. i guess today i really needed to listen to my body. i knew i felt too tired to exercise; i've swam several days in a row without a break and could tell i was too tired to swim.  it could also be that my adrenals are overtaxed; and i realize i haven't been taking any supplements in over a week; which means i haven't taken any adrenal supplements. so between that and being physically exhausted i should not have swam today. i was just gliding along with ease up until today, thinking i was doing great, dammit!""  i am assuming i should take today off, but then there's that school of thought that when you are in pain you should push through it or else you will ""freeze up""...and that pushing through it will help you to get past it.  help!!! thanks in advance! and remember, i've gone from being basically bedridden and doing nothing for about 3 years to swimming like this for about the past 3 - 4 weeks.  -------------------- no pm; contact: tracywill9@yahoo.com  13 years lyme & co.; small fiber neuropathy; myasthenia gravis, adrenal insufficiency. on chemo for 2 1/2 years as experimental treatment for mg."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
- one minute on a slow speed walk is a good start. wait. two days later, try for two minutes. seriously.  walk, don't run.  tai chi is the best for a gentle but deep full body workout that is non-taxing - so you can do some tai chi everyday. tai chi helps in so many ways. qi gong is similar and requires less turning of the head. also excellent and it can be done daily, and you can do it in short sessions, sitting or even lying down.  pilates is good too, starting slowly & gently. more detail here:  =========================  http://www.ilads.org/lyme_disease/b_guidelines_12_17_08.pdf  advanced topics in lyme disease (diagnostic hints and treatment guidelines for lyme and other tick borne illnesses  dr. burrascano's treatment guidelines (2008) - 37 pages  ------------ as important as any supplements, sections regarding self-care:  go to page 27 for supportive therapy & the certain absolute rules  and also pages 31-32 for advice on a safe, non-aerobic exercise plan and physical rehabilitation.  ---------------------- this is included in burrascano's guidelines, but you may want to be able to refer to it separately, too:  http://www.lymepa.org/nutritional_supplements.pdf  ** nutritional supplements in disseminated lyme disease **  j.j. burrascano, jr., md (2008) - four pages -^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
so...i've been swearing to myself that i was going to start exercising. i'm single again and not at all happy with the way i look...which is going to make me stay single for a long time if i don't do something about it! so, i moved my ex's old treadmill up to my room a week ago so that i could start. i then had a bad lyme week and wasn't able to start until yesterday.  i forced myself to do 3/4 of a mile, but honestly after the first 8 minutes (.2 miles) i was in agony.  my question is...do i push or am i going to end up hurting myself? is there a good/safe way to get into an exercise regime with lyme???^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
thank you for this post.  i am going to do some light weights today because i saw this. i have really gotten bad about exercise.  i will also do a protein shake. i'm starting to let the diet stuff go too.  we need to treat our bodies with respect no matter what condition they are in.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
thursday-hi, hi! well, did my usual 10 minutes on the treadmill, stepper and rower. ab dvd and thigh exercises. shoulder was hurting so no arm stuff today.  i should've worked out twice today because josh and i had banana splits. how can something so good be so evil?  hiker-what?! a needle overnight? that sounds ridiculous. what if you move in your sleep?  i didn't mention to josh how your school goes all out for teacher appreciation week. he'd be down in the dumps for sure.  he told me today he's considering getting his specialist degree. he'd have to take classes at night for 3 semesters. hope he makes the right decision.  kayak-mowing is hard work! i gave josh my self propelled mower. even using that one i'd get bouts of costochondritis. every summer i was heading to my gp for pain pills and muscle relaxers.  also, poor little etta! i sure hope she's going to be ok.  i was paying my old yard guy either $225 or $250 for cutting an acre plus weed eating.  tutu-i'm with you on the statins! still no swelling and very little pain.  i think my sleep issues must be from mcas too. i still pee a lot at night but not as much. i was going all the time during the day before i was put on antihistamines. no more poise pads! yay!  heading to atlanta after the gym tomorrow for some r & r. see you all later!    -------------------- do not take this as medical advice. this comment is based on opinion and personal experience only.  alaska lone wolf^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
friday-warm up and stretching before zumba today. just my old ab dvd for the day. also trimmed the bushes.  our yard guy accidentally broke the window in our storm door. a rock flung up from the mower and he didn't even realize it. didn't mention it because he's struggling financially so i removed that part of the door and lugged it around trying to get it repaired. no luck yet.  tutu-congrats on your team winning. yay! oxalates are a no go for mcad too! oh no! please, please chamomile and oregano do your thing!  hiker-your poor mom! i fractured my pelvis when i was 22 and i still have problems. the tailbone took forever to heal, i bet yours did too.  hard to stay motivated in regards to exercise. so glad me and mom go together. i'm going to enjoy it while i can.  i hope we all have a wonderful weekend!    -------------------- do not take this as medical advice. this comment is based on opinion and personal experience only.  alaska lone wolf^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
thursday-15 minutes of rowing, walked with mom, arm and inner thigh workout. also ab dvd later at home.  made a salad with baked chicken chunks on top for me, mom and josh for dinner.  hiker-sacrum is tailbone right? i fractured mine and also have had a torn groin muscle. both took a long time to heal. your mom had a fall right? also fractured my pelvis in 3 places and basically had to lay flat for weeks! also was wheelchair bound. your mom needs to go to an orthopaedic doc if you suspect these types of injuries. your poor mom! pain meds will really help and sitting on a cushioned donut helped my tailbone.  kayak-thank god your knee is ok! soft tissue damage is no fun, hope they have a good plan to take care of it.  tutu-yes, i was bad with the juicing again. i'm planning on doing just juice and water (fasting) to recover from surgery, detox etc. i'm going to post in the mast cell thread too. i went to the health food store today and bought dried loose chamomile flowers and oregano to battle degranulation. wish me luck!  well, have to wake up at 7:30 to let yard guy in our fenced in property. early start on exercise hopefully.  see everyone tomorrow!    -------------------- do not take this as medical advice. this comment is based on opinion and personal experience only.  alaska lone wolf^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
thursday-ab dvd this morning then hit the gym with mom. my usual 10 minutes each on treadmill, stepper and rower. thigh and some arm work thrown in for fun. afterwards we picked up some groceries then came home.  josh came for dinner. store bought roasted chicken, instant mashed potatoes, green beans and watermelon and cantelope was thankfully an easy do.  manna-has your hubs done any treatment before for parasites? its something i'd like to do myself. btw, my jaw dropped when i read you did 20 loads of laundry! were you able to do it in one day?  your fresh from the garden asparagus and radishes sound lovely!  tutu-your poor fil! prayers for you all. how in the world are they going to detox all the rx out of his system? you know i think they put my mom on a statin last year after her heart attack even though she doesn't have high cholesterol.  hopefully your fil will improve after the detox.  hiker-walking in the classroom counts too! don't feel bad about not having enough time to exercise. josh can't squeeze it in either. might have to do some stress relief instead.  my surgery is just the upper eyelids. i dread it and wish it wasn't necessary. not supposed to lift or bend over for 7-9 days. my plan is to fast on some red cabbage juice and water to detox and boost my health.  well....that's my plan anyways.....  see you all tomorrow!    -------------------- do not take this as medical advice. this comment is based on opinion and personal experience only.  alaska lone wolf^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

i thought i'd post this cuz others are talking aobut rotator cuff on here and i know ppl with lyme often deal with rotator cuff problems. i'm high risk for heart attack so wondered about the difference in the pain. the artical explains that and describes how rotator cuff problems can come on slowly with ppl with arthritis or posture problems. it also give some exercises.  shoulder pain: rotator cuff or heart attack posted apr 16 2010 4:58am we have all heard on tv that shoulder and arm pain equals a heart attack. but sometimes a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. now, seemingly out of the blue, your shoulder begins to ache and throb. very concerned, you rush to the local emergency room.  with resident?s first question, you point to your right shoulder and blurt out, ?am i having a heart attack?? the resident smiles, gently reassuring. ?a heart attack might give you pain in your left shoulder,? she says. ?have you been to the gym lately? this might be a rotator cuff strain.?  the resident knows that heart attack symptoms usually involve chest pain (in two-thirds of cases), and may include faintness, shortness of breath, sweating, and a feeling of impending doom.1 chest pain may spread to the back, jaw, and arms.  *** left arm pain may radiate to the inside of the forearm and the ring and little fingers.***  so, shoulder pain by itself probably doesn?t suggest a heart attack.  she orders an mri which shows mild damage to the right rotator cuff. what?s going on? what exactly is the rotator cuff?  the rotator cuff is a muscular sheath that surrounds the head of the arm bone (the humerus) and the entire shoulder joint (really, two joints ? the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints). the four muscles that comprise the rotator cuff help raise the arm to the front and the side and help turn the shoulder inward and outward.  if you?re a sports fan, you know that rotator cuff injuries affect baseball pitchers, tennis players, swimmers, and football players. such injuries are due to repetitive motion, and may also result from falling on the shoulder or arm or lifting heavy weights.  rotator cuff injuries may also be slowly developing and chronic, related to arthritic and degenerative changes in the rotator cuff tendon and the two shoulder joints. low-grade pain may develop, and the pain may become aching, throbbing, and chronic. raising the arm may cause pain, and there may be loss of mobility.2  in the above-40 population, lack of exercise and chronically poor posture may contribute to rotator cuff problems. sitting at a desk all day, with the neck jutting forward and slumped shoulders, places long-term mechanical stress on the rotator cuff.  chiropractic treatment may be very useful in helping to rehabilitate chronic rotator cuff injuries. the chiropractic physician is expert in evaluating postural problems and associated spinal conditions. by providing effective treatment, postural corrections, and rehabilitative exercise, chiropractors offer a comprehensive therapeutic program to reduce pain, improve shoulder mobility, and regain function. visit our website with the link to the side or call our office at 860-620-9523 and we would be happy to see if we can help you.  1source: cedars-sinai www.cedars-sinai.edu 2baring t, et al: management of rotator cuff disease. best pract res clin rheumatol 21(2):279-294, 2007. basic rotator cuff rehabilitation addresses loss of mobility. the two main activities are finger walking and pendulum swings.  in finger walking, stand about 18 inches away from a wall, positioned so your torso is perpendicular to the wall. reach your arm out to the side and touch the wall with the tips of your fingers. your elbow should be bent slightly. slowly walk your fingers up the wall as high as you can go. walk your fingers slowly all the way down the wall and repeat 10 times. as you continue the exercise over days and weeks, your range of motion will improve.  in pendulum swings, sit at the edge of a hard chair and bend your torso forward, supporting your weight by activating your stomach muscles and resting your non-working arm on inner thigh. let your working arm dangle to the side and, slowly and gently, begin to swing the arm in a small circle. the movement begins by a gentle swaying of your torso. slowly increase the diameter of the circle to a maximum of about 18 inches. the whole routine should take about a minute  -------------------- lyme? its complicated. educate yourself.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
hi everyone.  i would have to say i'm in a kind of remission. i have been off antibiotics for 9 months now and do a maintenance with herbs. detox is a huge factor as well as exercise.  i feel that even limited exercise is so important.  i treated lyme disease for over 6 years and babesia for over 3.  i would say that the majority of the time i am at 90 to 100 percent of normal.  i am so grateful that i am feeling so well. i remember when i could barely walk at all. there were times when i thought i may not make it.  please keep the faith and treat all of the coinfections. detox and exercise.  if i can get back to this state i truely believe that anyone can.  best to all of you!  katrina^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0

i'm already there, 100% for more than 2 whole years, without treatment, without lyme symptomt.  and like 17hens, i'm going to try a cure, even if i get bitten again, i don't want to fall sick again with this hell, so i'm still treating toxicity!  i'm trying to unload my body from heavy metals that still hang around, and any other toxic stuff that remains.  for those who are there, i suggest either this article below  http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/klinghardt-heavymetalchelation.html  or to take a look into polysans from sanum. they do something deep concerning 'clearing' old toxic load from infections, not very expensive and wonderful treatment, in my case!  i'm trying to build up cardio (jogging, biking), trying to apply the peak 8 type of exercise mercola suggests (impossible if you have lyme fatigue!!), doing taichichuan after 2 years of pilates and yoga, and still fighting chronic candida on and off!!  i had chronic candida at least 15 years before i fell sick with lyme. while lyme is gone, candida still comes back from time to time. ----------  my daughter is also in full remission for about 1.5 years.  and we are still getting bitten by ticks (she had 2, possibly 3 bites this summer, i had 4 bites)!  she's only been treated with ai (allergie immun) and with heavy metal detox stuff, on and off.  we're doing everything to be better than before lyme, so that we don't fall so sick again!!  after lyme got dormant, we took a long break in treatment, as we were fed up of treating!  now we're back, slowly, but as preventative!  keep on going!^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0
"kayak - i am glad you are on the elliptical more and the wheelchair is in the corner! that is a great thing!  i attribute my feeling of wellness to my commitment to exercise. even when i could only do 5 minutes a day, every other day, i did that 5 minutes. then i worked up to 15 minutes, then 1/2 hour until i could get to the 1 hour, every other day that dr. b suggests in his guidelines.  now, i have worked out for well over an hour and i work out every day. i added a treadmill to my strength training (total gym) and i also ride my bike a couple of times a week.  i do feel like i am cured and have very little residual problems.  i don't take any supplements or herbs for lyme anymore... and i don't need my megadose of antioxidants i took for 15 years because of my ""arthritis"" (tongue in cheek) that i had for 20 years that was lyme!  i think i was born with lyme and gave it to my son at birth. he is 100% too. he was very sick and in a wheelchair as recently as april, 2011.  i think getting well is addressing all the things that keep you sick. lyme is never just lyme. there are heavy metals, mold, bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins from household products, toxins from food, drinking water, water we bathe in and so much more.  getting the equation so that toxins in < toxins out = getting well and staying well!  -------------------- may health be with you!  toxic mold was suppressing our immune systems, causing extreme pain, brain fog and magnifying symptoms. four days after moving out, the healing began."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"andromeda13,  advanced labs checks your blood culture after 1 week to see if they have been able to grow any borrelia bacteria. if they have, they take a picture of the spirochetes & send it to you along w/ your ""positive"" results. if there is nothing growing after 1 week, they put it back & then do not re-check it for another 10 weeks. so, after a total of trying to grow the bacteria for 11 weeks, if they still can't, they send you the results as ""negative"".  so, i had my blood drawn on july 23, but did not get back my results until oct 5. as i said, they were ""negative"".  but, i still have symptoms.  my igenex results from feb 2011 were:  igm positive:  18 kda + 22 kda - 23-25 kda + 28 kda - 30 kda - 31 kda ++ 34 kda ++ 39 kda ind 41 kda + 45 kda - 58 kda + 66 kda + 73 kda - 83-93 kda ind  igg negative:  all bands negative except 41 kda + 58 kda +  positive for the dna of borrelia in my blood in 2 independent pcr tests.  positive for anaplasma.  negative for both babesia & bartonella.  so, the end result is pam (map1131) is correct that if you've had it for a long time (i've had it for at least 13 years without knowing) it may not appear in your blood, but may be in your muscles, brain, etc. or, maybe i just have adrenal fatigue & the lyme damaged my pituitary, thyroid, & hypothalmus (the sleep center of the brain). maybe if i can fix that, i will finally be able to get quality sleep again.  my big problem is sleep. i get non-restorative sleep. very, very shallow & don't get anything out of it. my hips hurt. i have terrible exercise resilience, meaning after i go out for a vigorous hike or jog, or walk on the treadmill, i sleep even worse for a week afterwards. i used to be a x-country runner & hiker (that's how i got lyme).  after i got back my ""negative"" advanced labs results, i went off abx again. i'm going to go to an endocrinologist & get my adrenals, hormones, thyroid, & pituitary all checked.  back in may, i had a cd57 test that showed mine was only 42. so, i don't see how i can be cured of chronic lyme when my cd57 was only 42. why else would my immune cells be suppressed?!  jennifermn"^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
many llmd's believe that daily exercise, as long as you are not overexerting yourself, is one of the best ways to get better. you have to listen to your body, though. it sounds like that is what you had been doing!  exercise is a great detoxer, aids in circulation and helps the abx to penetrate the tissues, according to an excellent llmd who runs webinars every tuesday night.  www.treatlyme.net  i am sad for you that your llmd has put this fear into you. i have been exercising as often as i feel comfortable doing so and i am convinced it has helped to speed up my recovery. i feel better on the days that i start off with some exercise.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

5 lbs isn't too much, but what happens when you first start to work out is that you will get pain in your muscles from use. it might be better to get the 2.5 pound weights and focus on increasing circulation in your muscles versus building muscle. you could sit on the couch while watching tv and do curls. once you get through that initial 'burn' when your muscles ache from exercise, you will be fine.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
dumbbells come in 3 pounds, 5 pounds, 8 pounds, 10 pounds, so forth.  what kind of routine will you be doing? i assume at home, since you are purchasing.  if you have not used these muscles in a long time/ starting out, you may want to start doing the exercises without weights at first  (example- lunges) you will usually feel the muscle soreness 2 days after you work that particular muscle- so start low - careful.  consistently working out with weights had been tremendous for me personally in many ways.  -------------------- lyme positive pcr blood, and positive bartonella henselae igenex, 2011. low positive fry biofilm test, 2012. update 7/16- after extensive treatments, doing okay!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
i recently started to exercise again approxamitly 1 year ago- i lift weights and do not do any cardio ... the past few weeks i have been having extreme pain in my shoulder joints that sometimes wakes me at night and is a throbbing , burning pain - today while at the gym i was half way through my routine ( usually an hour) when out of no where my heart started to pound and was rapidly beating , became dizzy , numbness tingly feeling s in my arms and legs ,extreme lightheaded and felt like i was goin to pass out - also had slight chest pain - this lasted approx 5 minutes ... thought i was goin to die . went to a cardiologist recently ekg was good and goin for stress test and echo next week - currently not taking meds but next month i finally have an appt with a well known llmd - have had lyme with positive babesiosis test for at least 15 years now - any and all thoughts , opinions ,are greatly appreciated  - all i want in life is to be healthy , be happy , and be a great father to my daughters .... but this disease makes that very difficult - sorry for the long post- thank you all for takin the time to read it!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
- someone in another thread described exercise intolerance from what should be fairly routine non-aerobic workouts in a gym. true, anyone can go too fast when beginning all this but -  - for anyone who is considering joining a gym, this detail in my reply over there may also be of help:  - as you recently joined this gym, the place itself is suspect, too.  the lights - probably fluorescent - are not good for anyone but can be especially draining for those with lyme & co.  the chemicals used to wipe down the equipment, others' scented products, the off-gassing of equipment itself - the padding and vinyl covers - flame retardants and petroleum products . . . .  cleaning chemicals for the floor, bug spray (if used) . . . soaps in the rest room or showers and  all the other stimuli: visual; auditory; etc.  all that can be a drain, even if you don't lift a finger.  i know my suggestion will not be a welcome one but, it seems to me that you need to stay away from that place and do similar weight training (you don't really need fancy equipment) in your home or other environment where you know you are fine.  then, you can get a sense if there is anything in the gym environment that is burdening you.  if you like the company of others in the gym, invite a couple friends to come to your place and create your own little group.  but, be wary of any equipment, even yoga mats can be toxic. see what you have around your home that can serve as weights.  a professional may be a good guide here for a few home visits. just tell them not to wear scented products.  you might also consider pilates, tai chi, or qi gong. -^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"- i just posted this at another thread on this topic and thought the exchange would be nice over here, too. -------------------------  some of us can't grasp anything so lifting weights may not work. just be sure to not irritate tender joints and tendons.  if lifting weights is not an option (or to add to that)  there are other ways to approach non-aerobic exercise. tai chi or qi gong can be very helpful and surprisingly strengthening.  not sure about how pilates might work for those with joint or tendon troubles but that is also worth looking into. a good instructor can help with alternate ways or suggest certain wrist braces, etc.  ""restorative"" yoga, too.  walking, even just strolling, is a vital exercise as well. gentle dancing . . . do things you enjoy and can do without equipment at various times of the day, at a whim. -"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
"- http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/can-exercise-be-bad-for-you/?src=me&ref=general  for some, exercise may increase heart risk  the new york times - fitness (feature)  - by gina kolata - may 30, 2012  excerpts:  could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people?  a well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.  by analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people,  the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, hdl cholesterol or triglycerides.  about 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. and the researchers say they do not know why. . . .  . . . they found it was not related to how fit the people were at the start of the study, nor to how much their fitness improved with exercise. . . .  . . . . dr. kraus said researchers needed to figure out how to tailor exercise prescriptions to individual needs. . . .  . . . dr. lauer said that if nothing else, the study pointed out the need to know more about what exercise actually does.  ``if we are going to think of exercise as a therapeutic intervention, like all interventions there will be adverse effects,'' he said.  he said, ``there is a price for everything.''  - full article at nyt link above  - and hundreds of reader comments  ----------------------------------------  yes, around 300 comments before mid-day. sadly, mostly from those who do not think about those who really can't tolerate exertion - for a variety of reasons.  and, most sadly, many hateful comments about those who are out of shape, with hurtful assumptions as to why.  one problem may rest with the opening sentence in the article:  ""could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people?"" (end quote)  i wonder just how thorough of an exam was given to all the participants? how many might have adrenal problems, liver problems, neuro dysfunction, or undiagnosed stealth infections?  knowing what i know about what lyme can do to a body has taught me that there is so much more to this picture of exercise tolerance.  they also did not call upon the few experts who have seriously studied exercise intolerance. too bad.

"- low level cardio  another matter of interest from sixgoofykids in response to a poster whose llmd did not want her working out on a treadmill and wishing she could move at a faster speed --  sixgoofykids writes: -----------------------  i just read  the primal blueprint by mark sisson  (also has a blog at marksdailyapple.com ).  he is all about low level cardio, which means slow walks.  his theory is that you can get a lot more movement in and do well for your body without draining the adrenals by over-exercising if you go for slow walks or slow bike rides.  even as a pilates instructor [inserting for clarification, that she has been in a solid remission now for quite some time],  i limit the number of hard workouts i do in a week, usually 2, then one or two moderate workouts (yesterday's was five minutes! usually the moderates are an hour but at an easy level for me).  we don't need to go all out every time we exercise.  for the rest of my movement, i walk . . . we never walk at high speeds or get our heart rates up. we stroll.  i think (but you'd have to ask your llmd to verify) that when we say we're using a treadmill, the docs assume we're doing a hard walk and getting our heart rate up, which takes energy away from healing. i would bet you'd be okay to do slower walking so that you can still keep with it.  you might like the book or website i mentioned above. his way of eating is lyme-friendly.

remember what burrascano says about t cell depression 12-24 hrs after exercise (more pronounced so with certain exercise it should be avoided). that said, yoga is so good for us. it clears the lymph glands really well.  so i think if it wipes you out that much you may need to limit your class time. maybe you can do half the class? those classes get really hot too, so you probably are getting rid of lots of toxins from sweating.  i know for me, i feel much better after i sweat, but i have to limit how much i do or i wipe myself out.  -------------------- --keep an open mind about everything. also, remember to visit activism (we can change things together).^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
i have no idea what's going on. for almost 3 weeks i've been forcing exercise to try to get a handle on my fainting/low bp.  i went from resting at 95bpm to 50bpm in under two weeks. i feel like i'm on a beta blocker as i'm unable to exercise normally now. my hr used to easily jump to 200 with running and now it struggles to get over 120.  the only medication i'm on is midodrine. i have not changed any of my herbs either. what the heck is going on? i caught my hr at 40 yesterday while sitting down awake. i'm not an elite athlete. i barely run anymore. exercise should not have been able to lower it this much in such a short amount of time.  -------------------- http://www.lymepie.blogspot.com^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
greta, i don't blame you for not wanting to go to a gym like that!  i exercise at home - walk on my treadmill during the cold weather and outside in the summer. this gives me the freedom to exercise in my own time frame.  i cannot lift weights right now due to severe tendonitis in my elbows, shoulders and ankles, so i an envious of those who can.  i think you are doing quite a lot as it is, but the idea of getting a dvd or a good book, might complement what you are already doing.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
i believe it is necessary to lift weights. to prevent muscle loss, muscle wasting and as stated in dr. b's guidelines.  the problem i have with it is:  1)somedays my arms are so weak i can't lift them to even turn taps on or off. turning the steering wheel is hard work some days. my legs give out on those bad days.  2) at work, i regularly lift things 50 pounds plus. climb a disgusting amount of stairs. is this sufficient for exercise on my work days?  3) when i get home i am exhausted-i normally only eat what i need to to take my meds and go to bed right away. lifting weights after work, even lifting a fork is hard.  4) to work my entire body would mean going to a gym. that turns me off completely. gyms in vancouver are meat markets for meeting up. it is a bunch of heavily tanned people looking for a stereotypical mate. (before you lambbaste me-the gyms here are like that. the only city i've lived in where folks do their hair, spray tans to go to the gym).  do you guys have any creative ideas for weightlifting i can do at home on my good days?  or any good links to show me how ?  i have exercise bands, 5 pound weights, and a exercise ball.  i really really do not want to go to a gym.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
despise gyms, so i workout in my basement.  that means no dues, easier to commit to...don't have to drive somewhere.  have got dumb bells , barbells, exercise bands ( i never use), treadmill, recumbent bike, slide board and power tower.  use my p90x, les mills body pump, chalean extreme and brazil butt lift dvds.  i've watched my muscles wither away over the past 5 years and have lost strength.  i'm back to working out every day, alternating cardio/weight days.  i have good and bad days, most of my issues now are left sided balance troubles.  in the past, my hands would hurt so bad just grasping the dumbbell that a workout was hell. quite often i could not finish an entire program.  last night i was super nauseous, sleepy and had no energy whatsoever. i forced myself to suck it up and lace up my tennis shoes. i actually surprised myself by doing quite well and was able to give 100%.  i try to push myself, because i truly believe that exercise is crucial in maintaining good health and strength.  i think your up and down stairs and heavy lifting counts as a work out.  i'd say find an exercise dvd, get some light dumb bells and do what you feel you are able. sometimes you'll surprise yourself once you get in the mindset. it also is great to boost your mental health and knock out some stress.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
don't push yourself too hard. my exercise is walking up two flights of stairs or taking the dogs out for a walk. i had to stop half way up one flight of stairs two years ago. i could hardly walk 100 feet without needing to rest. now i can walk a mile and i was doing it twice a day last summer.  but i don't think i am into an exercise program. i have a weight lifting machine in the attic, completely covered in dust. am i lazy or old or just sick?  i used to ride a lot but the bartonella did a number on me. i got horrible anxiety and i am still trying to recover from it. very depressing.  -------------------- old joke: idiopathic means the patient is pathological and the the doctor is an idiot^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0

my doc says that deconditioning/losing muscle is one of the main reasons why healing from lyme and co takes so long.  my ll reccomends starting with rebuilding muscle, and stretching to start and to go very slow.  never never workout to a place of being unpleasantly tired.  my ll told me the day after i exercise if i feel sore that i overdid it.  if the second day after i exercised, if i feel tired still then to skip the workout and do less the next time.  i used to play competitive sports 3-5 days a week, so it is difficult for me to see how much muscle and stamina i have lost.  depressing, i mean. somedays i can't even go up a flight of stairs without taking a break.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
adrenal fatigue may be responsible...if this is the case, exercise will make it worse...  also, if no adrenal fatigue, then being deconditioned may require a more conservative approach:  start with less exercise (shorten the duration, decrease number of repetitions on weights, etc.) and slowly build up to 1 hour.  -------------------- -razzle lyme igm igenex pos. 18+++, 23-25+, 30++, 31+, 34++, 39 ind, 83-93 ind; igg igenex neg. 30+, 39 ind; mayo/cdc pos. igm 23+, 39+; igg mayo/cdc neg. band 41+; bart.

"i think what you are describing is normal for a lyme patient. that's why burrascano says to never exercise 2 days in a row. you need at least 1 day to recover from exercise.  see these quotes from burrascano:  lyme disease rehabilitation  despite antibiotic treatments, patients will not return to normal unless they exercise, so therefore an aggressive rehab program is absolutely necessary. it is a fact that a properly executed exercise program can actually go beyond the antibiotics in helping to clear the symptoms and to maintain a remission.""  ""the goal is to exercise intermittently, with exercise days separated by days of total rest, including an effort to have plenty of quality sleep. the trick is to time the exercise days to take advantage of these rebounds. for an example, begin with an exercise day followed by 3 to 5 rest days; as stamina improves, then fewer rest days will be needed in between workouts. however, because t-cell functions do fall for at least one day after aggressive exercises, be sure to never exercise two days in a row. finally, an in intermittent exercise program, properly executed, may help to reset the hpa axis more towards normal. on the following page is an exercise prescription that details these recommendations.""  [both quotes from page 31)  ""conditioning: work to improve strength and reverse the poor conditioning that results from lyme, through a whole-body exercise program, consisting of light calisthenics and/or resistance training, using light resistance and many repetitions. this can be accomplished in exercise classes called ""stretch and tone"", or ""body sculpture"", or can be achieved in the gym with exercise machines or carefully with free weights (see cautions above).  3. each session should last one hour. a gentle hour is preferable to a strenuous half-hour. if the patient is unable to continue for the whole hour, then decrease the intensity to allow him/her to do so.  4. exercise no more often than every other day. the patient may need to start by exercising every 4th or 5th day initially, and as abilities improve, work out more often, but never two days in a row. the nonexercise days should be spent resting.  5. this whole-body conditioning program is what is required to achieve wellness. a simple walking program will not work, and simply placing the patient on a treadmill or an exercise bike is not acceptable (except very briefly, as part of a warm-up), as aerobics can be damaging and must be avoided.""

i know, i found similarly frustrating info when i went looking as well.  what works for me:  eating protein at every meal and many snacks.  trying to balance my meals with a mix of protein, high quality carbohydrates (whole grain, etc) and fruits and veggies.  eating as little processed food as humanly possible. there is a lot to disagree with on diet but i don't think anyone things processed food is good for anyone.  going gluten free was surprisingly helpful. not surprising to my doctor but it surprised me.  also, i tend to feel better without dairy, but the effect wasn't as dramatic as gluten.  good luck! the good thing is that you can try something and if it doesn't make you feel better, you don't have to stick with it. for instance, i felt terrible off of all carbs while some swear by it.  there is also an interesting book called eat right for your blood type. i don't follow everything in there but found the concept kind of intriguing and the idea that there is no one size fits all diet resonated with me.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

not many gi doctors know much about these things. i hope the doctor you are seeing is knowledgeable about these things...  the ginger chews are high in sugar, which we aren't supposed to eat when we have lyme. if i could swallow pills, i'd take ginger root in capsules - no sugar, and gives a more concentrated dose of ginger than the candy.  more info about h. pylori: http://www.mygutsy.com/is-h-pylori-the-cause-of-allergies-brain-fog-hypothyroid-autoimmune-disorders-adrenal-fatigue/  low blood sugar - may be related to subclinical adrenal fatigue. the diet for low blood sugar issues is as follows:  avoid sugar (cane/beet sugar, honey, molasses, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, fructose, dextrose, lactose, maple syrup, etc.) & artificial sweeteners.  eat a protein containing snack every 2 hours between meals. make sure to eat plenty of protein in each meal, also.  if you have to have something sweet, try low-sugar fruits (sour apples, blueberries, etc.). the fiber in the fruits helps slow down the absorption of the sugars naturally occurring in the fruits.  also, it is good to eat a protein and/or fat with the fruit, such as almond butter or a small handful of nuts, to help slow down the absorption of the sugars in the fruit.  celiac disease - i'd encourage you to check out http://www.theglutenfile.com for more info about celiac and non-celiac forms of gluten intolerance.  testing for non-celiac gluten intolerance/sensitivity can be done through http://www.enterolab.com (i have no financial connection with this website/lab, just am a happy customer).  i hope this info is helpful...take care,  -------------------- -razzle lyme igm igenex pos. 18+++, 23-25+, 30++, 31+, 34++, 39 ind, 83-93 ind; igg igenex neg. 30+, 39 ind; mayo/cdc pos. igm 23+, 39+; igg mayo/cdc neg. band 41+; bart.

- to me, yes, it sounds like lyme should be considered. it may not be and there are other explanations to consider yet, it's just good not to disregard the possibility.  the gait and balance issue do sound like lyme must be considered. lyme very often affects the inner ear and brain with balance / gait challenges -- and the spine issue you have does not explain all that balance / gait stuff.  so can other tick borne and chronic stealth infections.  the fact that certain symptoms migrate is also common to lyme.  diabetes can be caused by lyme. while type i, presumably diagnosed in your youth (?) . . . either lyme back then or some other infection could have been the cause / trigger.  best to be fully assessed by a ll doctor who can help you sort this out.  do sort out all your rx, of course, as well as any packaged foods.  a gluten free diet could be a huge help, too. gluten could be at the bottom of much of this, too. you might get a test for genetic celiac, a blood test. -  [ 12-10-2014, 10:47 pm: message edited by: keebler ]^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

"- one particular brand of olive leaf extract cured decades' old candida infection for me (along with a wise diet of only whole foods no gluten or dairy, yet one that could include low glycemic berries).  after decades of various antibiotics for all manner of respiratory infections having set me up with systemic candida, off of abx for a few years, i was able to clear candida with diet and various other herbal formulas & rounded out with ole toward the time i saw success - finally.  (but some methods were way too harsh such as caprylic acid and even oregano oil unless in a gel cap but that was never as effective as ole for me. i will never, ever take caprylic acid again. what torture for me in various ways -- just in case others might be having that same reaction. probiotics were important but not enough, alone, in my case).   yet, at a later time, i also took ole at the same time as a 2-month course of doxycycline - so i know it really works to prevent candida, too. it was a dream come true for me.  the key, i believe, was starting the ole a few days prior to starting the new antibiotic.  ole is just one of dozens of approaches of which naturopathic doctors are aware.  ole caused me no side effects at all, only helped improve several other symptoms at the same time it clobbered candida.  some brands of ole may not have the best results (seagate has a particularly excellent extraction method and quality control), however, and the dose needs to be started slowly - otherwise there can be a die-off.  die-off is not to be confused with side-effects, however, and can be managed by dose modulation.  if even the best quality ole is not a good match for a particular person, though, as individual response can vary, there are still dozens of other options. dozens. the ""how to find a ll nd"" thread here leads to other avenues.  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/1/115457?""""000000  ole (olive leaf extract) links -  [ 12-21-2014, 08:03 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

in my continued quest to get relief for my child from his arthritic pains, i am now trying an elimination diet.  brief history - he was born with congenital lyme and has suffered from hand and feet pains daily since about 1 year old.  he's on ibuprofen daily for years now and i don't know what to do once his stomach gives out.  he did about 7 months of abx and then a few months of herbs. nothing helped and his pains are as bad as ever.  my current theory is that because my wife was on abx throughout pregnancy, he was born without gut flora and has leaky gut syndrome. and leaky gut is the precursor to various autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis.  so our naturopath ordered a food sensitivity test through alletess labs in the form of an ige food panel.  the ige showed he had strong sensitivity to an unusually large number of foods. top of the list were the common ones like gluten, dairy, eggs, etc.and there were some weird ones including rice which is our staple food.  so we are on day 8 of having eliminated all these foods (very tough thing to with a toddler!)  sadly, his pain has not shown any signs of abating.  i would be interested in hearing others experiences with food elimination diets. did it help in any degree? how long can it take to notice any improvements?  i could sure use some advice/good stories right now to keep steadfast on this diet.  thanks!^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

my little girl started with lyme arthritis by the age of 2, after her first tick bite.  her pain in the knees were horrible. the only thing that stopped her pain, was stopping lyme disease, with multiple herbs, homeopathy, etc.  as soon as lyme comes back though a new bite or by relapse, her knee pain re-starts and she can have 0 pain in one day, and 100% pain in the next, with an extremely swollen knee in about 48 hours.  as always, anti pain medicine will never stop her pain. the only thing that works, is anti borrelial or anti microbial treatment.  so sorry to hear your small child is in pain. it is horrible to see them suffering.  for my daughter, what helped was treating the infection with herbs and homeopathy, loads of binders to avoid herxes. in the end, we found photon with nosodes as therapy, and that put lyme dormant for good for her and for me too.  we were always on specials diets. never ever we could eat everything freely. specially during lyme. you eat bad stuff for you, you just get worse. i do not think that only controlling food would have put lyme dormant for her though.  but diet is essential to anyone willing to fully heal. we are on gluten free diet for more than a year now, despite being lyme free.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

so sorry to hear this lp! you need to work on it so you feel better by monday, when you meet your kids and grandchildren. hope this helps...  five food suggestions for healing the gut  [1] if you think your gut bacteria ratios are heavily out of whack, eliminating high fiber beans and grains may be necessary for a while. one way to reduce fibers is to rely heavily on soups, good dairy, free range eggs, and meats from grass-fed livestock.  but you can stick with veggies by juicing often with a slow speed masticating juicer that separates the liquid from the pulp.  [2] at first, it may be necessary to use high quality probiotic supplements. but fermented foods and beverages should be added with gusto. miso, kimchi, live yogurts, kombucha, water kefir, and milk kefir are excellent sources of beneficial bacteria.  amazingly, probiotic microbes also chelate heavy metals and eliminate them with the stool. just make sure you use water that's been de-chlorinated and de-fluorinated for water-based beverages.  though not required, raw milk is ideal for milk kefir and homemade live yogurts. fermented foods and/or beverages are vital additions to anyone's diet. read more here: (http://www.naturalnews.com/027554_kefir_water_grains.html) and/or here: (http://www.naturalnews.com/033675_fermented_foods_probiotics.html)  [3] intestinal villi are tiny tubular protrusions on your gut's inner lining responsible for absorbing nutrients from food particles. leaky gut syndrome and celiac disease nullifies them. here's an easy, tasty ayurvedic remedy to recover your intestinal villi.  a couple hours after your last daily meal, take a tablespoon of organic raisins mixed with a tablespoon of organic raw sesame seeds. chew the mixture well before swallowing on a daily basis. that's it.  [4] coconut oil, preferably organic cold pressed, contains medium chain fatty acids that are easily converted into energy. it is also anti-microbial and anti-fungal, another remedy for getting rid of your gut's bad guys.  when it comes to fats, another source recommends trying for 1:1 omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid balance. chia seeds form a soothing soluble fiber gel while providing omega-3, and of course krill and fish oils do also. cold pressed virgin olive oil is a great source of omega-6.  [5] high quality marine phytoplankton in liquid form is probably the most nutrient packed green micro-algae superfood around, even outdoing chlorella and spirulina.  you'll get plenty of protein and more from any of those even while avoiding or restricting high fiber foods. but the right phytoplankton is the most super superfood according to health ranger mike adams.  (http://www.naturalnews.com/023853_marine_phytoplankton_microalgae.html)  ________________________________________________  how to heal your gut and heal yourself  a properly functioning digestive system (gut) is critical to good health. in fact, 60 -80% of our immune system is located in our gut, and 90% of our neurotransmitters (chemicals responsible for regulating mood) such as serotonin are made in our gut. problems in our gastrointestinal (gi) tract can cause more than just stomach pain, gas, bloating or diarrhea; they can be the root cause of many chronic health problems. gut imbalances have been linked to hormonal imbalances, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and hashimotos thyroiditis, diabetes, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression, eczema and rosacea� just to name a few.  so, how does one heal their gut and heal themselves?  in functional medicine we use a simple approach that we call the 4r program � remove, replace, reinoculate, and repair.  1. remove  remove the bad. the goal is to get rid of things that negatively affect the environment of the gi tract such as inflammatory foods, infections and gastric irritants like alcohol, caffeine or drugs. inflammatory foods such as gluten, dairy, corn, soy, eggs and sugar can lead to food sensitivities. i recommend an elimination diet and igg food sensitivity testing to determine if any foods are a problem for you. infections can be from parasites, yeast or bacteria. a comprehensive stool analysis is key to determining the levels of good bacteria as well as any infections that may be present. removing the infections may require treatment with herbs, anti-parasite medication, anti-fungal medication or even antibiotics.  2. replace  replace the good. add back in the essential ingredients for proper digestion and absorption that may have been depleted by diet, drugs (such as antacid medications), diseases or aging. this includes digestive enzymes, hydrochloric acid and bile acids that are required for proper digestion.  3. reinoculate  restoring beneficial bacteria to reestablish a healthy balance of good bacteria is critical. this may be accomplished by taking a probiotic supplement that contains beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacillus species. i recommend anywhere from 25 -100 billion units a day. also, taking a prebiotic (food for the good bacteria) supplement or consuming foods high in soluble fiber is important.  4. repair  providing the nutrients necessary to help the gut repair itself is essential. one of my favorite supplements is l-glutamine, an amino acid that helps to rejuvenate the gut wall lining. other key nutrients include zinc, omega-3 fish oils, vitamin a, c, e as well as herbs such as slippery elm and aloe vera.  no matter what your health issue is, the 4r program is sure to help you and your gut heal. i have witnessed dramatic reversals of chronic and inflammatory illnesses in a very short period of time by utilizing this simple approach.  http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-6172/how-to-heal-your-gut-and-heal-yourself.html  feel better!  steve  -------------------- everything i say is just my opinion!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

"i think the lyme diet is different for everyone.  that being said, i do believe that no one needs to drink alcohol. but, i do think it's ok to do if you feel ok after drinking. for a long time- years- i could not drink without becoming immediately ill. now, i can have some and not feel as bad, so i choose to have it at parties, etc, in small amounts. i do get drunk pretty easy, so i only have a little, and do this knowing it is probably doing harm to my brain, so it is a choice and i accept the outcome.  food: i go by more of what makes me feel good and bad and either avoid totally or eat more of. i notice many of the foods that make me feel the worst are also on the ""avoid"" list for my blood type. more on that here: http://www.dadamo.com/txt/index.htm  as per your list: -i get sick from eating anything coconut  -i eat tons of organic or naturally raised chicken and i think the focus on organic makes a huge difference  -i eat no cow milk if possible, with only limited amounts of cheese and that is like once or 2x a week . other milks i drink/eat/use in recipes are hemp, rice, almond.  -caffiene - i sometimes drink green tea and usually feel ok from that, but it is important if you drink caffiene to drink extra water that day to compensate for the dehydrating affects caffiene has on the body/brain! i drink coffee (love coffee!!!) only when i crave it , which is about 3x a month or so. i found that if  i drink it only when i crave it i feel fine afterwards, but if i go crazy and have it for 2 days in a row or more just because i love it, then i pay dearly with sx of nervousness and i clench my teeth for days after.  -sugar. well that is my hard one. i love sweet. i try my best to stay away from sugars, and that means fruit too. i drink no jiuce. i eat fruit rarely. and i do eat home made baked sweets becasue i am a weakling. i find that sugar in a candy form can make me dizzy and topsy turvy. and i can feel other mental effects from it. cane sugar i am also allergic to, so i thnk that may make it worse for me to consume than the average lyme person, but i am so addicted!!  - gluten. i try to avoid as much as possible. sometimes i chew a bite of pizza and spit it out in the trash. gross- but usually satisfies my pizza crave. i used to eat pizza at least 2-3 x a week! now, i eat only spelt and avoid the hybrid wheat as we know today. i try and limit spelt also.  i substitute with sweet brown rice flour sometimes, which is better than regular white rice flour- i think.  i am lucky to have a bulk healthy store about 30 min. away. owned my mennonites and has just about everything healthy in bulk which means good savings. maybe there is some place like that near you? ask everyone- you may come up with a lead.  we try and buy all our meat on sale. our local farmers market has a discount time on saturdays a couple hours before they close and sometimes we get great deals there, although the pickins may be slim.  i also buy the store brand of a lot of healthy / organic things at giant. much cheaper.  i don't skimp on some things- like eggs. they are always organic unless i am desperate and the store ran out. they cost more, but we eat a lot of them and it does make a difference.  i feel for you about the change in diet. i remember the first time- about 30 years ago- when a few smart people told me to give up white flour and white sugar. i went into shock just thinking about it.  i did, over a long time, do it. now i cannot eat any whole grains as i cannot digest them, and i totally avoid wheat- but that took years of talking myself into. the big plus you have is that you are single. this way you don't have to battle stubborn kids that like buns with hamburgers and potato chips 24/7, or a husband that thinks a meal isn't complete without bread!  sometimes i feel like we are a diner , with all the ways the 5 of us want to eat! i finally got my husband to join me in the o type diet, which is very similar to the paleo diet. about 3 weeks now and he looks so much better- now to get him off of beer! that would be a miracle!  when i was in the throngs of my undiagnosed days, i tested + allergic to almost every food. my allergist at that time was like your dr and told me to alternate the foods that were not on the total avoid list. this was hard, but i got into it and it became quite easy after a short time. i still try and do this with some foods. it makes a big difference.  dont' be afraid. go for it! the only thing you have to lose are feeling bad and maybe some pounds or inches. choose the best way for you. for me it was cold turkey in the beginning, and then wean in .... and out... and in again.... now i finally found what works for me.  to me- nothing is as important as diet. so even when we were completely broke and on food stamps i still kept those eggs and meats as clean as possible.    -------------------- ""the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits."""^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
i have found the restrictions for lyme patients to be a bit daunting in deciding what to eat.   i have been told to eliminate the following:  gluten sugar caffeine milk and milk products alcohol   what has been your experience when eliminating these things?   i also have a laundry list of other things to eliminate from my food sensitivity test.   the big things that will be hard to cut out are chicken and coconut, b/c so many healthy dishes have these two things in them!   i was also instructed to buy organic and the cleanest meat possible. i have found this to be very expensive.   i am a single person, so i am cooking for one. i am trying to come up with a food budget. this new diet is a little overwhelming.   she also wants me to do a rotational diet.   do any of your have any recommendations or advice on how to overhaul my diet?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
i looked at the symptoms for babs, but i don't seem to have them. i don't doubt it is possible.  i changed one antibiotic out and bam the very next day i was doing better. so i have two days of not so bad under my belt now.  also i'm going to work in esther c again and some different mushrooms i got out of the habit of taking.  i'm also wondering if not taking my supplements for about a month could cause a herx when i go back on them? i got depressed; and lazy. i have done a horrible job with my diet too. i'm just not getting one hundred precent gluten free after nine months.  the food transition has been difficult for me because i'm a skinny guy anyway, and i burn calories like crazy. i'm up to one seventy now though, which is much better than the one fifty-eight i was at when this thing hit.  when those old pains came back it sure scared me. i hope they stay away the worst part is the cognitive issues.  i'm so sick of my ocd i could spit nails. i'm constantly repeating garbage in my head and my anxiety is always borderline panic attack.  -------------------- lyme flare june, july, august of 2013. diagnosed september 2014 lyme, bartonella, mycoplasma, mono^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"- excellent point - treat / or set up preventive strategy first, preferably days before antibiotics would start.  a gluten-free diet would also help many. as, with lyme and with candida, either can cause ""leaky gut"" -- and so can gluten. so whatever measures to help address the gut lining, the better.  ole totally prevented any candida problems for me.  while i started that before the last antibiotic round i did for two month (and have never been on full treatment, ever as two months), in the past decades taking antibiotics for all the various upper respiratory infections that clobbered me (likely lyme undiagnosed)  candida was a huge problem for me if i even looked at an antibiotic.  probiotics, when i finally found out about them, just were never enough. ole saved the day for me with candida.  there are other anti-candida herbs, too, but they just didn't seem to have the same effect. and starting before antibiotics seems a good move at a time when candida is not at overgrowth stage or even close.  ole has been remarkable for me. i never would have believed it, after decades of such candida trouble. -"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
thank you lymeboy for your advice. i wish i could leave nj (im originally from mississippi) - but my husband has a state job - so we can't leave until he retires. i have anxiety just looking out the window here as we live in a very rural tick/deer/mouse/bear infested area.i am not offended by what you said.  i really like my doctor as a person he's great. he is an id but believes in chronic lyme. he doesn't know much about vitamins, nutrtion etc.. he never told me to go gluten,sugar or dairy free i just read those things here and on other websites. i see a holitistic rn sometimes. she is the one who found out i have mthfr .  so with the diet i just stop them all cold turkey?? forever??  i would love to see dr. h but not sure i could afford to see him. we only have 1 income for 2 adults and 3 kids....  if the iv abx are approved i will get rocephin and not sure what else. i have bart too.  i can deal with the lyme pain it's just the anxiety that kills me thinking im developing als. then i read all these articles how als is really untreated lyme/bart and the anxiety deepens.  after first year of abx i was in a really good place...then after my last child i declined and never made it back up again....he is almost 4 now.  i am just soo discouraged and really feel like there is no hope for me anymore. im obviously not one of the people who are never going to get well.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
agree with keebler, six weeks of abx is not enough if you've had lyme for a year. but maybe this doc is trying to see what your symptoms will be once on the med.  is your doc a real llmd? a lyme literate doc (llmd) knows how to treat lyme. it's never just lyme, there are almost always co infections that come with the tick. you also need a blood test from igenex. it is the primary test llmds use (more sensitive than mainstream labs).  you absolutely must take probiotics or abx will destroy your gut. my doc only put be on 36 billion, and it wasn't enough.  treating lyme requires a multiple approach, changing diet (gluten free, sugar free, dairy free). make sure to eliminate sugar or you will suffer from the abx.  have you read burrascano's guidelines yet? lots of info there (under medical).  lemon water will help you with herxing.  -------------------- --keep an open mind about everything. also, remember to visit activism (we can change things together).^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
- lyme most certainly can cause severe gi symptoms and leaky gut.  candida can as well but, sorry to say, if you have been diagnosed with lyme, simply treating candida will not be enough. not by a long shot.  still, imo, since you've been ill for over a year, i would certainly start both probiotics, ole -- and a gluten-free and dairy-free diet for at least a week before starting antibiotics.  it may be that month - or more - might be better as it can take up to a month to work up to the optimal dose of ole, sixteen capsules a day (as per walker, see ole links in your previous thread).  the gluten-free and dairy-free diet should continue. at some point, you might want to get a genetic test for celiac as that is certainly warranted for anyone with gi trouble.  ole does have some antimicrobial action beyond candida and while not solely enough to address lyme, could help a bit at the start to do first in order to help clobber candida. but only seagate brand for reasons posted in a previous thread of your.  while candida was totally under control the last time i went on doxycycline, seagate ole totally kept it from causing me a drop of trouble. but it did require up to sixteen capsules a day - the entire time that antibiotics are taken and for a while afterward. take a couple hours away from rx and from probiotics.  though the oral tincture that seagate now makes can be used to soak your mouth as you need.  well worth it for me, after many decades with candida over time.  likely you are already avoiding all simple / refined carbohydrates / processed foods. vital.  also assumed that no alcohol is on board. and even fizzy drinks, no matter how otherwise healthful, the fizz can just eat through the stomach lining.  you'll need to stay out of the sun - totally - when taking doxycycline. and, doxycycline alone will not be enough. you should be on a combination of antibiotics and another drug to help combat the cystic form of lyme that antibiotics won't touch.  be sure you have a true llmd - and first discuss any questions about all this with her / him. good luck -  [ 07-02-2015, 03:41 am: message edited by: keebler ]^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

"- any infections can cause weight gain, independent of a good diet.  however . . . cookies? hmmm. that is likely exhaustion driven, i assume in kindness. yet, that habit is dangerous and will lead to disaster.  lyme and coinfections can predispose one to diabetes, so simple sugars are best avoided.  still, there are other ways you can find some immediate foods that are whole food and sugar & gluten free.  sugar substitutes are just as dangerous, if talking about artificial sweeteners.  stevia, imo, is not at all a substitute for sugar because, in its own right, it can stand on its own and serve to sweeten. but be sure to get the real thing, some is not what it claims to be.  but, any cookie is still simple sugar because its ground to flour. any flour is sugar. period.  whole oats (but be sure they are certified glutenfree on the package so wheat has not contaminated them) can be part of a nice breakfast but you'd also need some good protein and some whole colorful vegetables &/or low sugar dark berries.  chicken soup is really excellent for breakfast as would be salmon, kale and a little bit of yam.  it may be hard but the idea of a sweet breakfast is best put down to mistakes of history. somehow, that nutritional disaster seems unique to the u.s. and started with industrialized processed foods. our health has declined since, as a nation.  there are many excellent foods to enjoy. make a double dinner and save half for the next day's breakfast, etc.  more about how infection can cause weight gain, and how to get an upper hand on that with delicious, nutritious and satisfying foods.  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/1/112235?""""000000  topic: borrelia weight gain? and what helps. -"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
three of my children were very intolerant of dairy and soy products in my diet. i breastfed them and finally learned to adjust my diet during pregnancy to lessen the chance of causing it. it was a horrible thing before we learned what caused all of their screaming. one child's growth rate doubled when i eliminated all traces of dairy and soy. the soy intolerance developed after the dairy intolerance. i didn't know to rotate the foods.  one family member with lyme has developed many food intolerances that looks like a gluten intolerance, but all the blood tests come back normal.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

blymey, great you feel better on diet and herbs.  people on drugs only believe they have the stronger treatments, while the immune system will go much better with diet and herbs!! they are not weaker, but better than any drug combination!  our western brain thinks drugs are like guns: better to eliminate the problem.  the body thinks that nutrition, cleaning, and support is much better!  what is inside ohco coldsnap? i tried to google but it just says it's something for the immune system, that reinforces the chi.  isn't it just a tcm plant that you can buy for nothing in bulk?? i wonder.....  if you would like to see my thread on the tesla wand, many problems of food absorption, vitamin d absorption, and detox were solved. i mean decade old problems, of the kpu, of urine that goes out like water, no sweating...  then after years without being able to eat gluten, my daughter could finally eat it again. we still avoid wheat, because wheat is too full of gluten, but she eats many other gluten grains (like spelt), daily, without problem.  thanks to a 30 dollar high voltage device we bought in amazon (or was it ebay)?  high frequencies help cells and energy in a way we could never dream of. so easy, so effective, if you'd like to try.  another cheap treatment that helps our organs, cells, tissues, is schussler salts. we buy one mix of all schussler salts and take it daily. very inexpensive, and it supports cellular activity. it's like a boost to put minerals inside the cells. it's even better than food or mineral supplementation only. you can read about it in the internet.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

all i have to add is that after reading about the diet he suggest i found that going low fat and leaving wheat out of my diet made me feel better. seems he says the diet is very important also.  i look at fat content on everything i buy and purchase gluten free products.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

i've been 6 years totally lyme free, and my daughter got only 3 short relapses (that lasted only 2 weeks), then she's also lyme free.  for us, the only thing that stopped lyme from coming back was photon treatment. before, i could only be lyme free for maximum 4 months, then i relapsed (or got bitten again).  now we still get bitten, but we don't fall sick anymore.  muscle tests is what we did (energy testing). without that, shooting in the dark could lead us nowhere. we went through cleaning teeth, cavitation, heavy metal detox, vaccination detox, all sorts of diets (when they tested).  now we consume again gluten, we never stopped dairy (but we do prefer goat or sheep milk products), but we stopped many other things. sugar, we don't miss at all. you can use stevia sometimes, or even honey (if your candida is not active).  without energy testing, there was no way out for us. we could reach remission before photons only with energy testing. then we know if we had to stop eating certain foods etc.  anyway, i know we would still be sick if we didn't have energy testing...  for borrelia, the only thing that stopped it haunting us, was photons with nosodes. but for all the rest, parasites, heavy metals, etc, was energy testing and art that took us out.  the only problem you need practically daily testing, or weekly, at most, if you want to get out of disease...  anyway, we are still treating (food allergies, candida, teeth, gut, minerals...) so that we don't get again back to hell.  i hope you find your way out! it is easy to get to 70%, but the last 30% is very hard, specially without energy testing.^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0

hi folks:  as some of you may have read, i'm dealing with a moderate flare/relapse after 2.5 years of feeling 95% and off antibiotics.  i meet with my llmd next week and will also have some art/energy testing done before hand to help give advise.  just wanted to post this to get some input. i know you are not me, but what would you do given my symptoms:  right now i'm dealing with: -increased tinnitus -increased head pressure, particularly on back of head and sometimes top of head -increased eye floaters -moments of hot flashes. usually am and pm. example: 5 am and then 5 pm. daily. sometimes with sweats. -no fever. low body temp (97.4) -muscle twitching, mainly calves -cold hands/feet -hoarse voice / gerd / reflux symptoms (although no heartburn -foggy feeling at times. -off balance, woozy at times -a lot of head/neck/face/jaw muscle tension -low back pain -bladder discomfort. perineum discomfort. comes and goes. -waking early am (4-5am)  some of the above seems very bart or brucella. others seem very babesia / proto.  i'm currently on rifampin and mino and have now changed to sugar/gluten/dairy free diet.  i've had most of these symptoms before. most of them were original /old symptoms but many have flared in recent years when doing antiparisitics. specifically: -hulda clark -dr. k parasite protocol -alinia -lariam  when i have done all of the above, i have had incrased floaters, twitching, and back of head pressure, etc.  do you think my issue is more babs/parasite, or bart/brucella / other?  i'm having a hard time figuring this out. feeling a bit better, but not where i was before. i hate this.

there are many pathogens and disease processes that are dependent on us to feed them glucose through our own dietary carbohydrate. i've had tbd's for many years, but switching to a gluten/grain free (very) low carb diet made a huge difference. i've been eating this way 6+ years.  ketogenic diet isn't too easy to maintain without proper dedication. to get the physiological adaptations, serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate or b-ohb) have to brought up to and maintained at 0.5 mm or higher (ketones in urine are not indicative of b-ohb levels).  this requires tightly controlled macronutrient ratios, different for everyone. if there are underlying insulin resistance issues then protein often has to be kept pretty low until a certain amount of healing takes place.  most low carb diets can get the body adapted to burning fat and healing a lot of damage even though they aren't strict enough to induce a constant state of nutritional ketosis.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
the ketogenic diet is generally used in epilepsy when meds don't work. and it is supposed to be very effective. however, there are downsides too. while it may sound more appealing than drugs, the diet is deficient in a variety of nutrients and requires a lot of monitoring. it is used under close supervision with the guidance of dietician, doctors, etc. so please ask your doctor first before trying it!  one recent development in epilepsy is to do a halfway approach by limiting carbs or going gluten free. apparently some families didn't fully comply with the ketogenic diet and still had good results. that's for epilepsy tho not for lyme.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
- while she considers a nd or l.ac. there are some things that might help if this inquiry is about mood.  adrenal support is important for anyone dealing with mood issues. so often, depression or anxiety can come from deficiencies in the adrenal system.  thyroid, too, should be assessed. in case she may be on some thyroid meds, a caution: the t-3 drug, cytomel nearly cost me my life more than once from the sudden drop late afternoon when it wore off.  a combination t-3 & t4 in a natural thyroid rx like naturethroid helped me get out of that disaster.  a gluten-free diet can help, as can avoiding all processed foods. getting enough protein and lots of good veggies, dark fruits in moderation - and good fats.  a dinner with wild salmon, greens, a bright veggie . . . and blueberries for dessert -- or that as a breakfast is excellent for the brain / mood.  avoiding all scents at home, in car and where ever else possible.  get rid of vinyl shower curtains, if they are there. a fabric type is best, polyester that dries fast.  mold in home / car should be considered.  glues that can be toxic in particle board furniture / cabinets . . . new carpet or paint.  an air flush 2 x a day of all rooms in the home is a good idea regardless.  sunlight into the eyes first thing in the morning for 20 minutes. rather day light (not the direct sun rays) directly into the eyes with no glass in between.  dark chocolate - 80% or higher - about one ounce a day.  being sure key nutrients are balanced and magnesium is on board.  magnesium may be the best anti-depressant in the world. -  [ 02-25-2016, 06:40 pm: message edited by: keebler ]^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

an't rely on allergy testing... what you really have is food intolerance! it's a true sign of lyme disease, at least for me it was. i think it has to do with what strain of borrelia we have, which causes these food intolerances. some say it is due to leaky gut, i think there's more going on, for instance why people get bit by a lonestar tick, they then develop a meat allergy. scientistis say the meat allergy has to do with the alpha-gal that the ticks transfer over. so really, it may not have to do with the lyme bacteria at all....  it could be possible that you got bit by a tick that didn't have lyme disease, but transferred some coinfection over instead... in all honestly though, you probably do have lyme, i'm just giving an example how complex this disease is with coinfections.  if there's people with lyme in your area, i would say it's time to get on antibiotics pronto!  i would feel sick and get headaches any time i eat gluten and sugar, major fatigue too. then i went on a low sugar diet, stripped out the gluten, made me feel so much better. but it didn't stop the infection, which got worse and cause debilitating arthritis in my joints. for borrelia, it can take up to a whole year before you feel the joint pain and once it's there, it stays there.  personally, i feel the mold bit is so exaggerated. sure it's not healthy living in a moldy environment, but if you say you're close to suicide and feel seriously ill when you eat, something seriously wreaking havoc on your body.  at first i thought i had some form of candida and exposure to mold in the house too, it just felt that way because i was becoming more sensitive to odors and developing food intolerances. after toying around with this for year, the inflammation set in with my wrists... that's when i knew something was seriously wrong!  4-5 years has passed with taking antibiotics and i'm almost 100% better. i'm no longer lactose intolerant. i can tolerate gluten better, but still feel inflammation any time i eat bread, so i stay gluten free... it took some time, but the antibiotics do work therir magic. certain ones definitely worked better than others, such as flagyl. wish i would of went on ivs, but really who can afford it, insurance wouldn't pay for mine...  hopefully another year, be 100%.  tip:get your bloodwork done at igenex, regular test came back false negative for me...^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
i do not consider myself gluten intolerant but went gluten free after reading about dr. frys discovery of the biofilm-forming protozoan previously referred to as fl1953 and only recently renamed to protomyxozoa rheumatica, a highly immunosuppressive microorganism. he refers to it as the premier pathogen.  i couldn't afford the test so i went on the diet he recommended for a week. it consisted of very low fat diet with no wheat as the fl 1953 protozoan thrives on the high arginine in wheat.  i felt so much better on the diet and when i went back to my old diet i could feel my symptoms flare again.  just passing this along as it made such a difference in my health. the diet is very important for suppressing the protozoa. i also use my rife machine to knock back the protozoa versus antibiotics he says to use. link below.  http://www.betterhealthguy.com/dr-stephen-fry-on-fl1953^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"do you have a gluten intolerance or not? try the spelt litmus test  (warning -- this spelt challenge test is not for true celiacs, as is clearly stated in this article from us news & world report)  http://news.yahoo.com/gluten-intolerance-not-try-spelt-litmus-test-131906849.html  the increased popularity of gluten-free diets has been accompanied by well-publicized debates as to whether widespread gluten intolerance is a real ""thing"" or just a fad. as a clinician, i leave the in-fighting to my colleagues in the research world and choose to focus instead on issues of more practical relevance to my patients. namely: if you don't have celiac disease but you seem to feel better on a gluten-free diet, do you need to stay gluten-free for life in order to stay feeling well?  the way i approach answering this question with my patients is quite simple, and it's been incredibly helpful in separating -- wait for it -- the wheat from the chaff when it comes to suspected non-celiac gluten intolerance. i call it the spelt litmus test. but before we launch into the details of this most elegant litmus test, let's first get grounded in some context to help explain why the test works so well, and what you might expect to learn from it.  wheat is not comprised solely of gluten (nor is wheat the only source of gluten, for that matter). gluten is a protein that comprises one portion of a grain of wheat, alongside other nutrients like carbohydrates and even some fat. one specific type of carbohydrate that wheat contains belongs to a family called fructans -- essentially a short, poorly digested chain of fructose molecules. when people who do not have celiac disease consume wheat and believe they react badly to it, it's common for them to automatically assume the gluten is responsible. but since gluten is only one component of wheat, that conclusion is not a given.  this may be particularly so when the adverse reaction to a wheat-containing food is digestive in nature -- gas, bloating, stomachaches, constipation or diarrhea -- since other foods containing high amounts of fructans are known to provoke these symptoms as well. anyone who's ever suffered after eating too many sunchokes, onions, garlic, asparagus spears or energy bars containing inulin/chicory root fiber, can probably attest to that.  for many people without celiac disease who nonetheless struggle with digestive discomfort and irregularity, such reductions in the amount of fructans they consume can make a big difference in symptoms. but over time, many patients report to me that they start experiencing episodic symptom attacks -- despite following their gluten-free diet strictly -- and they can't figure out why. this is precisely when i'll suggest the spelt litmus test.  spelt is an ancient grain related to wheat that contains gluten. unlike wheat, however, it's low in those poorly-digested fructan carbohydrates, rendering it a perfect test food to help clarify whether someone's adverse reactions to wheat-containing foods likely result from a gluten intolerance or a fructan intolerance. people who are truly gluten intolerant should react badly to spelt. people who are not gluten intolerant should tolerate spelt just fine. (and, for liability reasons, let me be clear: people with actual celiac disease should not consume spelt, and people with wheat allergy should avoid spelt as well.)  in order to figure things out, i typically advise patients to buy a spelt-containing food that has very few other ingredients. spelt pretzels, spelt matzoh, spelt flake cereal or spelt ""rice cakes"" typically work very well for this purpose. then, i advise patients to replace a portion of a usual breakfast or lunch meal that they know to be well tolerated with a 1-ounce serving of the spelt food. if all goes well, i'll have them increase the portion the next day to 2 ounces. if there's no reaction once gluten-containing spelt has been back in the diet for three or more days, it's likely that a person doesn't have a gluten intolerance at all, but rather just a digestive system that is sensitive to effects of a particularly poorly digested carbohydrate.  for non-celiac gluten avoiders who pass the spelt test, eating gets a whole lot easier -- and potentially more nutritious. there's no need to avoid foods that have trace amounts of gluten but are low in fructans, such as conventional oats, conventional soy sauce, or barley malt used as an ingredient in otherwise wheat-free foods like crisped rice cereals or potato chips. there's also no need to worry about cross-contamination when dining out at restaurants from trace amounts of flour, breadcrumbs or shared deep fryers.  sandwiches can be made from spelt bread, which has far better texture and flavor than most gluten-free breads. spelt pasta can replace conventional wheat pasta. baked goods can be made with spelt flour instead of wheat flour. since whole-grain spelt is higher in fiber, iron and b vitamins than most conventional flours and starches used to make gluten-free baked goods, trading up to spelt, if tolerated, makes a lot of nutritional sense.   tamara duker freuman, ms, rd, cdn, is a registered dietitian whose nyc-based clinical practice specializes in digestive disorders, celiac disease, and food intolerances. her personal blog, www.tamaraduker.com, focuses on healthy eating and gluten-free living."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

"- 20 years ago (before properly diagnosed) i was misdiagnosed with bipolar before it became clear that lyme / tbd & adrenal dysfunction was the real issue. and that doctors who knew nothing about those just wanted to slap a label on me.  psych symptoms, in my view, indicate a serious irritation to neuro cells / fibers / functions. but there are other things involved, too.  i say all this in hope. but my thoughts jump around a bit, sorry. too much noise outside to think.  but, oh, that reminds me. if your inner ear / balance system is even a little bit off kilter (as lyme and lyme rx can do that) - this can also cause all kinds of mood reactions. and it makes perfect physiological sense. i just can't explain it, though, i'm too dizzy right now.   sometimes, a particular nutrient is deficient. some rx can make that more profound, too. many deplete magnesium. and the right kind of magnesium, in divided doses 3-4 x a day can really help in some cases.  but all the different psych. brain / mood rx - a parade of different trials - caused me even more trouble because (turn out i'd later discover) i had porphyria and these were very toxic to my liver, hence to my neurological system, too. i could not process them so it became a terrible situation.  lyme also makes everything harder. and anytime any rx is added, that shifts it all again. so man rx can be very hard on the liver / kidneys.  cytomel (a t3 rx) did cause major mood drops every afternoon when it wore off (that drug nearly killed me). when i got on a natural thyroid with t3 & t4 (naturethroid), that afternoon depressive crash resolved but it took time.  is liver & kidney support adequate? (when the liver is stressed, there will be psychological results, always.)  adrenal & thyroid support, too?  there are many aspects at work here but i find that those two areas are major to consider with any kind of mood issues or the like.  glucose stability as well. a ""low carb"" diet was terrible for me. what i really needed was a lot of good carbs, the right kinds of carbohydrates. and this included black & wild rice, quinoa, millet, etc. along with good vegetables, protein and good fats.  be sure to start you day out with good protein. protein can really help keep mood steady.  going gluten-free helped a lot, too, as gluten can cause inflammation and anytime there is inflammation, the brain is going to be affected, as will mood, imo.  what also helped was getting off of aspartame / diet sodas. the excitotoxins in food additives, i thought, helped me to wake up - but then they would drop me like rock. -  [ 04-04-2016, 03:46 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

take goat milk products or sheep milk products. much better and less allergenic than any cow milk product.  we take both (also cow milk) but we do do not have lyme anymore.  i was fed up of dieting during lyme treatment and i did take cow milk products (not pure milk though), like yoghurt and cheese.  and during lyme, i avoided wheat in all forms, as it tested bad for me. i took though spelt, that is much tastier than wheat. i love spelt. it does have gluten though.  during lyme, i ate less spelt than today (no more lyme). i do feel better without gluten, but my life would be harder to live without spelt (pastas, pastries, bread,... they are fantastic, much better than wheat.  i find that avoiding sugar and alcohol made me feel much better during lyme too. anything feeding candida will feed borrelia, in my feeling.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

"- gz's suggestion for magnesium - well, if epson salts aren't enough for you, be sure to get magnesium in some other form. it's the first thing to consider. 3-4 x day, not all at once. and the right kind matters.  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=123746;p=0  topic: magnesium - informational links set   what are you doing from the inside out? topical relief only goes so far when the trouble is deep inside.  turmeric / curcumin capsules (to reach therapeutic dose) often help. i find berberine to help tremendously with joint & muscle relief.  avoiding gluten, too. gluten (for some people) can cause tremendous pain - and damage - to joints. the inflammation connection.  other dietary assessments might be helpful: dairy, corn . . . oxalates. pay attention to see if any particular foods might ""talk to you""  cayenne can be a helpful thing, too, either in your food (if you can handle a little heat) or in capsule form.  organic foods are also best - as farm chemicals can really zoom up inflammation in the body.  liver support is essential, too - again, inflammation is involved. as a stress or overloaded liver (or kidneys) can cause all kinds of pain in joints, too. milk thistle is a good basic. see the one earth website below for a chapter on this.  of course, if tick borne infection is the underlying cause direct / assertive treatment for each / all of those matters yet these other things can help along the way, too.  and, if nerve issues are more a problem than inflammation, magnesium is still key there yet a medical mushroom called lion's mane can also be of some help to nerve health.  if this is with your hands / fingers, a wrist brace (like used with carpal tunnel issues) can help at night or when using your hands. -  [ 05-28-2016, 04:36 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
i'm so grateful for this thread after feeling that folk here felt that there was something strange about me when i have tried remedies and they have not worked.  i try things and get nowhere. i had some tests done which show that i am chock full of metals and toxins especially arsenic and lead.  i have been trying to get my food intolerances sorted out as i felt this was the first step and got to gluten dairy lectin sugar and anti-thyroid vegetables free diet but now think that i have developed a rice allergy. so now i wonder if i should do the rotation diet. today i excluded rice and feel lousy. one thing about rice i found is that it is sometimes contaminated with arsenic. i was using rice protein and brown rice milk but that maybe why the allergy - too much of it.  i am finding it hard to keep going but hopefully i will respond to the rice exclusion. it was one of the main parts of my rapidly reducing diet. i will start on the baths though and drink more. i even had a bad reaction to the electrolite drink others use. it is stupid but i feel ashamed because nothing helps. thanks again.  mati^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

- noodlydoo,  from what i've read about the paleo diet, i don't think that she's advocating a total paleo diet (but, then, there may be variations of that or she may use that just as a reference point).  at her website, she shows cooked meat and onions. the strict paleo diet suggests raw. the kale appeared to have been steamed in the video. so, at least there, she would differ.  looking at the table of contents to the book, paleo diet is not mentioned.  the index lists references to the paleolithic diet on just two separate pages.  now, i've not looked at the rest of the book yet but in the 17 minute ted talk,  she mentions food sensitivities and allergies to gluten and dairy but she goes far beyond that to food that feeds our cells, particularly or mitochondria - and food that supports, even helps repair the damage to the myelin sheath around the nerves.  she shows us how much to eat; shows people what kale looks like. she discusses nutrients and what starvation does on a cellular level.  so, far beyond suggesting avoiding certain foods, she leads us to what our bodies have been craving all along, specific nutrients to feed our cells - nutrients that are missing on most dinner plates.  ========================  at the amazon link, you can do a word search inside the book. using ?paleolithic?,  page 28 . . . just a brief mention of the paleolithic diet.  page 154: in 2003, she did start some version of the paleo diet. . . . then other variations . . .  . . . november 2007, she started a different food protocol and variations from that point.  in the video, she said it was not until 2007 when she began to see real progress 3 months after starting her intense produce and clean protein approach.  as she has many recipes in the book, you can get a sense of the foods she recommends by reading through the index. legumes, and brown rice recipes are there. lamb, too.  many supplements are also listed and, looking up glutamate, she does suggest avoiding it as it can cause neuro-excitability. i've sure experienced that with it.  she suggest magnesium to calm down neuro-excitability from toxins. it's good to see her include that.  i can't wait to get this. i've heard that we should have 8-10 servings of produce a day but not 9 cups. seeing her before and current self is amazing.  glad there are so many kinds of leafy greens. i've been waiting for this, i think. been close regarding the choices, but not nearly so in the volume.  so glad to have seen the video. thanks, again, haley. -  [ 12-02-2011, 03:17 am: message edited by: keebler ]^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
so i have been on a gluten free diet about a year. i don't notice any improvement at all.  to be honest i am getting really annoyed. it's been such a hassle, i can't eat anything when i go anywhere. it seems like a severe diet when no one can show me tha it is actually beneficial.  i'm happy avoiding most gluten free foods, but sometimes, i just can't see how a single slice of pizza is causing untold damage.  i've been avoiding gluten almost two years, though about a year ago i went to a wedding and ate food with gluten. i felt fine.  i restarted it for the past year...any gluten ingestion has been accidental. i am pretty strict, though i wouldn't know if i've accidently ingested some. i was told a soup i ate was gluten free, then the next time it wasn't. i didn't notice anything after eating it, so i have no idea.  i just don't know if i should continue or not.  it's summer so i'm dying for a plate of fried clams. or a donut. i'm too afraid to do it though. i just wish i knew if it was helpful or not.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
we continue on the gluten free diet.  we're still in the adaptation phase, as it takes some time to find old recipes, and new ones.  but not willing to come back to gluten!  still happy without it, and now i don't say my craving is zero, but it's not that far from zero.  we're next to 100% gluten free (just not sure the food we consume outside is really 100% gluten free).  non-organic bread, cookies, pasta is also coming out of our list (now that we found what to eat instead!).^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
amazing, isn't it?  i never thought of food as medicine would be like that...  i think when people get close to 50, many get joint problems.  even younger people, in their 30s are having joint problems, man and woman equally. it's not only infections, i believe. it's mostly food!  i feel the effect of food in my body very clearly now. since i eliminated gluten, my body got more tuned, more 'aware', awaken.  every bite of food that comes in, it's a whole sensual experience, that goes through very subtle levels.  i am enjoying the experience, as it feels like the 'awareness' (or 'awakeness', if that exists...) that i get from fasting.  but the difference is that i'm not fasting!!!  it is more expensive to buy foods (organic, specially), when you do not buy grains any more.  but surely, you got to vary more on nuts, dried fruits, veggies, beans, miso, seaweed, etc.  i feel much calmer, much more grounded, i'm sleeping deeper too. it is enjoyable, even though more job to cook and shop for food.  but as my mind is clearer, and i have more energy, so i am improvising the meals, inventing stuff, experimenting. it is fun too.  the wheat documentary says that giving your body the right foods will make certain genes wake up and work properly. they said about 70 or 80% of our genes can be steered by us, and the environment.  it's pretty a lot, isn't it? genetics is not a fixed science, because of epigenetics!  giving bad foods, dead foods, toxic foods will steer up other genes, that probably cause us more disease. it's like a talk with your body's genetic code, through food.  a bit like saying: 'look how much i care for you, i give you only good food, so give me health back if you are grateful'.  the other side of the picture is: 'look how much food with pesticides, glyphosate, neurotoxins, plus dead food (white flours) i am giving you, body. every day, on and on. i know you are not happy, but please don't make me sick.'  well, it doesn't seem to work this way!...  my joints are saying 'thank you' to myself. i am having some funny joint reactions and a sort of funny lymph ball going on (like some joints get suddenly bit swollen, then hours later, they will get normal, then my whole lymph gets drained...).  my urine continues to be so dark, so i'm taking care to drink more hot water.  the whole experience is like fasting, really. like re-setting your body again. i feel things going on inside me, as though suddenly, my inner-steering engines started working again.  really, this is so much similar to my fasting experience, but the advantage is that i can do it for much longer than a couple of weeks!  i'll make a 10 day vacation to france tomorrow, so i don't know how much will i be able to cope (with my diet), but let's see.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
i just re-started a gluten free diet about a week ago.  the amount of energy i have has more than doubled.  i am not 'allergic' to gluten, like my daughter was. we thought she was cured.  but then, 2 weeks ago, she went to a school camp and i ordered her gluten free meals (because she can't digest wheat well).  she came back so energetic. she said all kids were having cramps from climbing on walls and trees (it was a climbing camp...), but she said, for the first time in a loong time, she didn't even have cramps or muscle pain!  last year, she had been eating gluten again, and slowly, her health condition went down... immunity problems, some fatigue, catching more colds than usual, stuff like that.  let's see how long we can keep on that diet, but i'm just writing to say that it is not the first time i experience such an increase of energy due to special diets.  i also experienced that during lyme, when i cut a lot of foods that tested energetically bad (allergic).  i have no longer lyme, but i will keep gluten free. it makes me feel so much better, lighter, i even need to eat less because i think food is better absorbed.  i am pretty sure that cutting gluten will boost immunity, in our case. only time will tell.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
sorry to know that michael.  are you on allergy free diet? meaning, no gluten, no soya, no milk (usually), and avoiding certain nuts, fruits etc?  if there is just one item being consumed where you are allergic or intolerant (like gluten, for example), nothing can heal your gut, except total avoidance.  just a single bit of intolerant foods being ingested brings catastrophe, inflammation, all the heck to the whole digestive tract. no matter how many probiotics, organic fresh foods you take, binders, etc, there is no way to heal the internal lining.  that is why i use energy tests to know what can come in my body. not 100% certainty, but at least, it's a sort of guide to this extreme complex topic 'gut health'.  i guess, if we all had perfect gi tracts, we wouldn't be sick with lyme, for almost sure...  this gi puzzle is what we are all unfortunately lost inside. add gmos and glyphosate (round up), there is no way out, i think.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

i do think the gluten story is true. i feel so much more energetic without gluten and so does my daughter.  as for veggies, we do eat a lot. and when we do, it is true that carb intake goes naturally down (just because you are full of veggies).  i was thinking that it is so hard to change diet.  i have a rule: i change one thing at a time.  for example: i cut on one thing at a time, or i add one thing at a time. then i make a little rule: example: i will eat 1 raw veggie a day.  i let it sit for a while, and follow it like a prayer. when i find the rule became a habit, well i change something else.  every time one thing only. sometimes it is very hard to change this only thing: example, you decide not to consume any animal product that is not organic.  well, that will take some time and money. if you are not ready, do not do that.  my old rules are: - at least 3 different raw veggies (or fruits) on one meal - preferably veggies of different colors - mostly organic, if possible - avoid buying any animal meat that is not organic - always eat one green leaf veggie every day (cooked or not) - never eat breakfast without at least, a fruit - never add sugar to anything - add good spices to cooked food (like garlic, ginger, cardamon, onions, paprika...) - eat (omega 3) fish at least 2 times a week  my recent rules are: - no gluten - at least 1 probiotic food at the table - eat 2/3 of veggies in a meal  i promise that it is not boring, nor tasteless. for me, food gets more and more tasty, instead.  i have real pleasure in eating like that, because my cells thank me. that is why i can keep adding new rules, tuning the diet.  food is medicine. i have no doubt about that.  the point is that you only notice when you tune the diet for your health condition. the more your health improves (and gut health improves), you have to keep adjusting the diet.  the biggest problem is how to change from a sick diet to a healthier one?  that is when i came with the one at a time rule. otherwise, it is impossible, specially when you are still ill with lyme.  you have little energy, and you are overwhelmed with lyme treatment and feeling crap, and you still have to cook and change your whole eating habits (including shopping habits, social habits, etc). doing one change at a time, is an easier way to tackle the problem. it pays back, i swear!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
couple of things.  paleo is not raw....its paleo...or caveman diet. which, is basically meat (cooked is fine), vegetables, fruit and some nuts. it's a back to basics diet. corn chips are out, as are 95% of modern day convenience foods.  the diet isn't about what you can eat, it's about what you can't eat. if the theory holds true, (and i believe in it 100%), then eating legumes, dairy, gluten, tomatoes (a veggie exception), nightshades (another exception) and a few others will set your immune system into action.  i think that most people fail with this approach simply because in todays society, there are so many failure points with holidays, friends, fast food, convenience foods etc. it takes a particularly strong will. however, there are some people that think walking and bladder control is more important than dairy.  and it only takes a sip of dairy. your body doesn't measure your intake. you either have these proteins present.......or you don't.  again, i have not looked at her website, but i can guarantee you that its a paleo diet.  personally, i don't think it's a curative diet. although i have read several times of people eliminating many symptoms, or improving greatly......i tend to think that it is an arresting diet. simply, start eating right and ms will stop progressing.  glm - although i think many lyme patients would do wonderfully on this diet, it has nothing to do with curing lyme. lyme is from a bacterium and probably other co-contributing factors. this theory around ms is presented as an allergy (over - simplifying this of course).  the reason people with lyme should consider a paleo diet, is simply because it's an anti-inflammatory diet. so many of the foods that are not paleo make your c reactive protein skyrocket. it puts your internal system under great stress. if you read about these types of diets, you'll see that so many people clear themselves of so many issues with a proper diet.  it amazes me each and every day how little importance the public puts on what they ingest. it can have such a profound impact, both positive and negative. but few people will ever fully realize this simple fact.  cheers.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
me: you mean the gluten cravings?  i guess, i had mostly bread cravings, let's say.  i think the craving is more like a habit problem than food craving, in my case.  in the morning, i was used to take bread. point. now i do not take bread. so i have to find out what to eat.  it was harder the first 2 weeks.  after a month, i don't even think i'm craving bread /gluten anymore.  yesterday i dreamed i ate a croissant, by accident.  i felt so bad after in the dream, and was regretting. then i woke up, and sighed: 'oh, it was just a bad dream!'   i'm pretty sure people can lose a lot of weight on wheat / gluten / flour free diets. not because they hunger, but because they eat less.  it doesn't have to do with lack of alternatives to eat. it's more like you eat well, more real fresh foods, and then you simply feel less hungry. that's what i feel has happened.  it took me about a month, i think, to get used to not take gluten anymore.  i also abandoned all those awful gluten-free products full of toxins, dry bread etc (schaer brand, here in europe).  i found one specific bread-like thing, looks more like potato pure than bread, made of whole rice in my local organic shop. i eat one slice, and i'm full.  i make a sandwich with goat or sheep cheese, add some cucumber and a lettuce or so in that rice 'bread'. it keeps me hunger-free until 1 pm.  early morning, i take as i said above, some yoghurt, cheese, kefir, or simply coconut juice. at 10 that sandwich. until 1pm, i feel fine.  i don't think it's the food carvings the biggest problem. the biggest problem is more habit and social. it's not physical, if you see what i mean.  i hope you guys find your balance and your yummy foods!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

"- i think so. i kept passing out due to lack of enough carbs to hold over the veggies. another poster here expressed the same thing about needing some grains as veggies tend to ""wear off"" sooner without them, even with protein and fats on board.  the non-gluten grains can hold food longer in body for slower digestion and help for glucose stability. be sure to study their nutrient composition and their glycemic index. generally, the dark colors are best. and something like 1/4 cup cooked to 2 cups of veggies.  some others also said they could have a small amount of low glycemic fruits. i think they hold nutrients not in veggies that are very valuable as antioxidants.  there are some ranges of opinion on candida diets. and each person may have variation in their nutrient / composition needs.  it may be that if candida is way out of control, a stricter diet is best for a few weeks to get it under control.  read all you can from the key books / articles on the topic. and get the few good books on diet for both candida and (at least) two lyme diets.  you might want to take a class in mediterranean cooking, too.  then you'll have a range of opinions to consider as you determine what works best for you glucose stability.  but do not skip meals. that boomerangs. there is no need for that with a diet that provides necessary nutrients & flavor from the three food groups and variety of fiber sources.  olive leaf extract was very good for me, too, to really clobber candida (even when taking antibiotics). -  [ 06-20-2016, 07:31 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

hi all,  i am writing to you a day after a hospitalization due to methemoglobinanemia (induced by an antibiotic dapsone--> lack of oxygen to cells). not fun. for some, this drug seems to be helpful but i guess my body couldn't take it. plus my local lab screwed up and didn't monitor my levels properly, which ultimately led to this mess.  here's my story: i was misdiagnosed from july 2013 (at 20 years old) up til late march 2016, with ~ 3 years of symptoms of lyme prior to proper testing and treatment.  it started with me feeling weaker and less alert. my symptoms only grew from there and now include terrible brain fog (reading is difficult, expressing myself through writing is difficult, simple math becomes nearly impossible, analyzing a graph or anything at all is a tremendous undertaking yielding minimal results, spelling doesn't work out so well), memory and word recall issues, depersonalization, severe and constant cracking and stiffness of joints (back, neck mainly), widespread pains and aches/physical fatigue and burnout, overall body discomfort and lack of stamina/energy that one should have in their early twenties, chronic migrating itching and burning and some air hunger. i was a great student at columbia, had a great job lined up and now i can barely do anything. i've had to put work on hold indefinitely and each day is almost pure torture.  i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia (18/18 trigger points) and then chronic fatigue in 2014. i've tried tons of drugs, physical therapy, chiropractic, yoga, meditation, massage, my diet has been radically clean and healthy (gluten free, dairy free, alcohol free, added-sugar free, red meat free, caffeine free), and nothing has helped me gain a real improvement.  i started a lyme protocol under dr. h in late march 2016 (rotating between drugs- now on rifampin, plaquenil, nystatin, omnicef (pulsing 3x weekly), zythromax (taking 4x weekly), ldn etc and also doing the extended herbal buhner protocol etc. i have recently introduced detoxing supplements and activities like ir saunas and enemas etc. every day is just medications and activities to minimize suffering. i haven't found anything to bring about a sustainable improvement in years.  on the lyme protocol so far, i have not felt any better, only worse. i was wondering if anyone here at any suggestions/ experiences they would like to share.  for the late disseminated folks who got treated many years after onset of symptoms, what was your healing trajectory like?  what's worked for you and what was the timeline?  any thoughts on ldi, rifing, and hyperbaric treatments or anything else?  thanks a ton, melz  [ 07-11-2016, 08:06 pm: message edited by: melz ]  -------------------- melz^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"thanks for the thoughts wpinva and keebler.  i don't suppose there's an at-home test for deficiencies? regardless though, i still need good food.  my wife does cook, so i just want that out there. it's just that she cooks a lot of beef, and beef isn't cutting it. plus, my family just doesn't understand that many times i can't get up and get my own food, even if it's already made. so i lay there and starve a lot.  pumpkin seeds were great. i kept packs by my bed, and i just ate them whenever i was hungry. 800 calories in a pack! they helped me feel better for a while, but now it seems like my body is missing some other nutrient that pumpkin seeds don't have. i feel like i'm starving again.  you know what my body really needs? carbs. i'm one of those people who feels very physically ill without carbs. i basically haven't eaten any carbs for more than a year now. except for today. i found a gluten-free dairy-free pizza in the freezer, so i popped it in the oven. but my candida is terrible, so what's a guy to do??? i'm already starting to suffer from that decision, but my body is thankful for the carbs at the same time.  i can be upright for a few minutes at a time, so aids in the kitchen wouldn't help. i have very bad orthostatic intolerance. if i could cook laying down that would be excellent! the pizza was doable because i only had to be upright a couple of minutes to get it in the oven.  are there any good nuts that are ok with candida? like i really crave cashews, but i've read that mold in them isn't good. i really need foods i can grab easily without cooking. maybe something dehydrated? something i could order online easily. i haven't been doing fruits because of the yeast.  i know this is asking a lot. good nutrition done easily. but i'm in a very tough spot. my doc did suggest deeper greens powder by ortho molecular. but that's just a small start.  oh, also i am somewhat lactose intolerant, so most dairy isn't doable. otherwise i'd drink milk. before i was ""lymed"" i loved milk. gave me severe colon pain, but i drank it anyway. i know, not a smart idea at all, but i loved my oreos and milk. gosh, i wish i could just be me again.  i love mushrooms, but aren't they bad for candida too? i tried eggs but i have a mild egg allergy. they really upset my stomach. i wish i could follow the whals protocol. her diet is the best one i've ever seen.  sorry for the enormous post. i'm at a loss for what to do."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
it's so funny you guys talking about broth, so said, easy to digest!!  my, i get the worst problems of bloating and such a bad feeling with organic fish or chicken self made broth... i was wondering how this could heal me, if i can't even sit after taking sips of that...  as i said, there is no standard diet. broths may be easier if totally diluted, but if not so much diluted, i swear they are one of the hardest thing to digest for me.  as for carbs, i can't let them off either. i know my body does not like loads of carbs, but i can't drop them (grains, i mean).  not for the moment. i dropped gluten with very good results.  don't desperate. many have been in your shoes, don't think you are the only one.  just go one by one, one item every week, increase one more and so on. that is what i did to my 10 month old daughter, who reacted to almost everything. then i knew what she could eat and what she couldn't.  as for myself, my list keeps changing, but i never fix it forever. i love fruits, never stopped them either. i also love veggies, so it's not a problem for me to increase veggies.  have you tried also quail eggs? easier to digest, richer in vitamins than chicken eggs.  as i told you, what saved me were energy tests. without these, it would have been hard to find out what i could eat or not.  just don't give up. you're not alone!!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
ive been tested for food allergies and some foods did come up but then was told by other gi docs and another allergist that those tests aren't worth anything(blood tests for food allergies)  ive also had a couple of skin prick tests done and all that swelled was the control,not a thing else.  ive gone months on a strict no carb ,no gluten diet with no results.  i will have a die off when starting a strict no carb or an anti fungal,hence why i always go back to my candida diagnosis.  i have about 4 years of a daily food and supplement and bm diary,and how i rated each day.  the diary is a great tool and i refer to it often looking for patterns.  it has shown me constipation,sugar and fiber seem to be the culprit.  hate to say it but i have come to the point where im desperate but i will continue on and keep trying things,get some help to cope if need be.  the frustrating thing is there are a few windows where i feel fairly well for short amounts of time but still can't figure it out or gain ground.  see what this elimination diet brings,maybe try baby doses of probiotics, maybe try yogurt(never tried that for fear of yeast).  im game now to try anything.  protecet you gut if you are on atbx.  i remember years of lyme,it was horrible.  this is just as bad^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
sometimes just by changing the diet as you are doing, your body may start working better.  that means, it will have energy to do what it couldn't before, due to poisoning, allergenic foods you were eating, junk food, too many oxidant foods etc.  the body is too busy taking care of junk, sugar, gluten, believe me!! it has little energy left to be activating your detox and immune systems!  there can be not only die off, but there can be simply detox.  i lived that a few times, specially during fasting.  recently, i stopped gluten suddenly, from a day to another and felt an immediate shift in my body's metabolism.  somehow some fatigue came, due to detox (watch urine color, or stomach pain). stomach pains for me are 95% linked to toxins dumped by the bile in my stomach.  i know it, just because the pain stops about 15 minutes after taking chlorella (binder). that's been happening to me and my daughter since we stopped gluten, about 2 months ago (or so).  after detox, binders, you get just more energetic. at least, that is what has happened for us.  i do eat fruits though. i've never stopped eating fruits.  i would take some chlorella to bind toxins.  after a month without gluten, and changing habit, shopping and cooking, i swear to you, i do not feel really sad i stopped eating gluten.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
i'm finding it even better now on special diet than before. before was boring (pasta, pizza, bread), now it's very colorful!!  yoghurts, quark, kefir, and a variety of sheep and goat cheese (breakfast), with some fruits (i love any berry, cherry, figue, watermelon, melon, peaches and varieties of peaches).  then all the dry fruits (of course, this is not anti candida totally, but i swear my candida does not come back because of the fruits!!).  fruits have good yeast that fights bad candida infections too!  then coconut juice (very yummy). if you do not like, just add anything a bit sweet to it (with stevia, for example).  stevia: how to prepare it: either buy it in powder and use it one anything hot (porridge, cooked fruits). or do a strong tea, keep it refrigerated, and add it as sugar to anything.  add butter when not too hot. most foods get tasty when you add some butter or ghee.  as for veggies, eat most raw when you can (just a bit, not a lot). forget that 'portion' thing. just eat a bit, for the taste: carrots, pepperonis, cauli flower, celery, cucumber, zuchini (it's lovely raw), tomatoes, leaves (spinach, lettuce) whatever really.  i made a rule home: 3 raw veggies at least at lunchtime. whatever they are, i just cut them in small pieces, lay them on the table, my daughter loves them.  when i do not have 'veggies' enough, i add fruits instead: a piece of apple, a piece of melon, a bit of cherries, a bit of avocado to fill my the 3-raw-veggie rule.  or i make a nice sauce with raw onions, garlic and fresh herbs then that counts as 'one raw veggie'.  believe me: it gets less boring when you need to do specific diets. in our case, we are trying hard to eat low carb, gluten free. but i don't cut fruits.  that makes me cook more beans. any type of beans, there is a whole variety of tastes, and ways to consume these beans, cold, hot, in soups, in curry-like sauces.  for breakfast, during lyme, i used to still eat carbs, but cooked (like cooked oatmeal or other flakes), with ghee butter, water, stevia leaves and one whole fruit (banana, apple, pear in winter, and any other fruit in summer).  now i added a new rule: at least once a day anything live (yoghurt, cheese, fermented foods like fresh olives, kimuchi, miso soup...).  if you eat miso, and you like it, you can simply use the miso paste to eat with certain veggies (i love it with cucumber and carrots).  if you like miso soup you may add anything to that soup: any sea beasts, fish, shells, shrimps, mussels, only your imagination stops it. plus you add sea weeds, that are so rich in iodine.  i swear to you guys, the less you eat wheat and carbs, the more varied your diet gets. unless your brain stops you from trying new things.  it takes time, a bit of courage to try new things, but the palette of flavors and foods that exist is big!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
- rheumatoid arthritis is most often caused by lyme, other tick-borne or other chronic stealth infection. immuno suppressive drugs are a ridiculous thing for something that usually has infection as the cause.  also consider a gluten free diet and a genetic blood test for celiac - regarding any inflammation in the body.   you say you could live with all else as your knees are the main issue right now and you can do so much.  just be aware that, for many, it starts at the knees - their first symptom -- and maybe not all the time, either. if lyme is on board, it seldom stays there.  i can't say that just right. i'm toast. just understand how the progression can happen.  good luck. -^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"- oh, just so everyone knows, ""mexican"" or ""spanish"" rice in many restaurants is just loaded with gluten (and likely msg and some sugar, too). i found that out the hard way - after many seizures. they add gluten to the flavor packets for thickening. who would've every thought?  and, often the darker color is not because they use darker rices (as i thought), it's the coloring added.  best to avoid problems but if there is a problem after eating out, you can look online for foods and maybe trace their ingredients.  in advance, not at the table when ordering. this can be very disruptive and usually just won't work during a busy seating.  or call the manager during non-busy hours and ask for clarification and how to find out exactly what was in sometime so that you will be better educated the next time / or can avoid problematic ingredients.  i am forever grateful to the manager at a famed burrito place for his help in this way. he opened my eyes.  lyme diet cook books - there are a couple good ones with delicious meals just waiting for you. -"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

what does aip mean?  so some of you only eat protein? no veggies or fruit?  i was probably 85% paleo for 2 years before i got ill and still am ill. would be interested to know if anyone else was low carb, gluten, dairy and sugar free before getting lyme and what changes you might have made diet wise that helped.  thanks^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
my daughter has a similar problem to yours. she now can eat wheat, but after so much pain in the past, she is afraid...  lyme made my and her allergies much worse. they increased clearly in number of allergies and in intensity.  when lyme was gone, we got better from many allergies, but not all were gone. for her, gluten remained.  i think lyme is a gut disease, in my view. it is linked to candida (that always affect the gut, no matter if the candida looks to appear elsewhere).  as lyme weakens immunity, parasites will also grow. just think about lyme bacteria, bart, all the other parasites, then lyme toxins, herxes, whatever, all dumped in the gut through the bile.  i do think our guts are not made of steel, and as every single lyme sufferer suffers from the gut, well, allergies and digestive problems may arise, even when lyme is gone.  for us, lyme is long gone, but we still need to fix our guts.  we test people energetically for more than a decade. i never found anyone that tests good for wheat. agro-business transformed old wheat into something for exclusive commercial purposes, and the amount of gluten in our modern version of wheat is way too high compared to other less commercial crops such as spelt.  add that gluten to glyphosate (not only for gmo crops but for any non-organic grain crops), and the mix becomes a gut bomb.  glyphosate (round up) will destroy good bacteria in the gut, and allow very pathogenic bacteria to grow (such as clostridium, that is the cause of botulism, extremely pathogenic!!). there are studies done in germany among farmers who are in contact with glyphosate.  if you see people affected by glyphosate, their tummies become flat, their muscles wasted, they can't digest well...  every time lyme infection got reactivated, or i got bitten again in the past by a contaminated tick, i just waited less than a month and many of my food allergies returned. it was very fast.  my daughter gets better and worse concerning gluten. sometimes hit looks as though problems disappeared, then they come back in revenge.  now we finally decided to live gluten-free. we see immediate results (more energy, less fatigue, clear mind). so we keep on going. it is not as hard as it seems.  it gets hard if you stick to same products (like bread, cookies, pasta), but if you shift your food and cooking habits, it isn't that hard as it seems.  the number 1 tennis player jokovitch is on a gluten free and milk free diet, and he said he sees a lot of profit from that (he is not sick, of course, but he needs to be gluten free to have the energy to continue being a high performance sportsman). he even wrote a book about how his diet changed his sports career for good.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
what makes us so sensitive?  i don't know the answer, but i can guess some items below are, at least, partially responsible.  ------------------------------------------- 1) i believe that is reason number 1: excess of toxins overwhelm the immune system.  our organs cannot cope with cleansing so many toxins at once. we become then over-reactive.  toxins: - from infections (biological debris of immune wars our body rages against pathogens) - from drugs we take (the body has to get rid of drugs) - from excessive die off herxes (when we add killers) - from food, air, clothes, cosmetics, water: toxins such as heavy metals, food preservatives, colorants, pesticides, fungicides, etc  toxins are in my opinion, the first culprit for messing our immune systems.  we get weakened to fight cancer, infections and immune reactions start to go after the wrong targets such as ...  ... our own food, our own hormones (such as histamine, insulin), our own organs (such as cartilage in our joints), our most basic elements we need for survival and detox (such as sulphur).  against pathogens? nope. our immune systems lose the ability to even recognize pathogens and continue attacking the wrong targets.  liver, kidney, lymph, gut: all get overwhelmed with toxins and cannot work properly.  so you get further problems to detox.  is there anyone fighting chronic infections that have no problems with the liver once? if not yet, just wait. it's just a time bomb. -----------------------------------------------  2) leaky gut (due to infections, parasites, candida, food allergens, food intolerance, too much gluten, imbalanced diet, ...  ... gmos, pesticides and fungicides that kill good bacteria, toxins, ...  ... especially glyphosate from round up, that alone makes the whole flora a real mess).  bad flora = allergies increase  leaky gut is thought of being caused by food allergies (specially gluten). if one continues eating inflammatory foods, the whole body gets into that 'alarm' mode.  you may start reacting to things that, in normal conditions, you wouldn't.  leaky gut = undigested big food molecules go into the blood stream = the body thinks this is bad (as it cannot use big molecules, only tiny molecules), so it attacks these molecules.  you get newly allergic to what you just ate.  is there anyone fighting chronic lyme that have good working guts the whole time? nope, i don't know anybody.  bad gut health goes hand in hand with chronic lyme... -------------------------------------------------  3) lack of energy to perform any cellular activity properly: the mitochondria get defective, no way to detox cells, to nourish cells, to kill bacteria, we just go on sort of stand by for all living functions.   add excessive electrosmog that just damage our most needed proteins which are the building blocks of life (hormones are made of proteins), well, we lose the essential building blocks that allow life to thrive.  bad enzymes = cell life is barely possible.  how can our poor immune systems be still working properly, when all our cells are just not working on the most basic levels?  ------------------------------------------------ these are just some thoughts.  it's not one reason, i think. it's the cumulative problems that ravage our immune systems. when my lyme is dormant like it is, for more than 7 years, i get much less 'new' allergies.  the moment it gets reactivated, i just wait a couple of weeks, and i'll start reacting to many foods i never had trouble with before.  i don't believe it is only lyme. i think it is because, without lyme, in my case, i can still cope with many stressors, but when i add lyme, my immune system goes into 'banana' mode.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
it's nice you guys are all in the gluten free diet.  i'm also trying it recently, and i feel so much more energetic (let's say, i have more energy longer in the day).  today i did my first gluten free pizza. not that great, but daughter wanted to eat pizza.  i'm not someone that really likes to go for tests... i just try diets, if they feel good, i go on.  i don't think tests catch many health problems, anyway. i trust my gut more than a lab test.  i haven't stopped casein, but i may try that too.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

"- and, a gluten free diet might be something that could help minimize some symptoms. if you start that now, by the time you see your llmd, you might have something to report on that. many with lyme have problems with gluten - for various reasons.  excitotoxins - also good to learn about and try to address prior to seeing your llmd. avoiding artificial sweeteners, too, is important for reasons discussed here. stevia - from a proper source - is fine and can add some enjoyment for you in green tea, etc.  re: food additives  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=3;t=029690;p=0  excitotoxins; msg; aspartame; & ""natural"" flavors (that are not likely natural at all).  gmo foods that destroy the gi tract; gluten; dairy. -"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
i never stopped fruits, not during lyme, not after lyme. i love fruits.  i still have sometimes candida, but what is helping me is to add live food (probiotic food, not supplements) to my diet, daily, like a religion.   when candida is too high, i go slower with fruits.  the best in my opinion is to stop gluten. somehow, gluten makes my digestion slow, it messes up with my digestion.  fruits, veggies, never really mess with me. only when i'm allergic to them.  juices is though in my no no list. too much sugar at once.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
hi folks:  my daughter tested positive for lyme in may and did 3 months of abx. now in remission (thankfully!)  when she was diagnosed, she was given an elisa for food allergies / sensitivities. she came up high in wheat and gluten.  we put her on a gluten free diet to see what happens and she had a celiac panel done to rule out celiac.  fast forward to august, one of the markers on the celiac panel came back positive, but all others negative.  she had gluten while we were on vacation for about a week and didn't seem to have any issues.  but about 3 weeks ago she had gluten again and got severe stomach cramps and then vomited about 1-2 hours after eating it. the same happened about a week later, and then again this past weekend.  at first we didn't think this was due to gluten as she had it all week in early august and was fine. but now we see a definite pattern. if she has bread / gluten / wheat...she gets bad cramps within 2 hours and then vomits hard.  i've got no idea why there is this change in only a few weeks. the only other thing i can think of is she was on abx when she had gluten in early august. and now she isn't.  also, one of our children was diagnosed with pinworms (gross) and she did 2 rounds of pin-x. and since then she is now puking when she has gluten.  any ideas?  i know that mold sensitivity and gluten sensitivity are closely related.  -------------------- bite date ? 2/10 symptoms began 5/10 dx'd, after 3 months numerous test and doctors  igm igenex +/cdc + + 23/25, 30, 31, 34, 41, 83/93  currently on:  currently at around 80% +/- most days.^0^0^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

hi guys!  since september i've been having a hard time understanding my reactions. i've been on different things trying to detox or boost my immune system with different practitioners, but they never truly addressed the core issue which is lyme (and possible co-infections) that is very much chronic and active.  i would react to the supplements i would take, my tolerance for supplements became even lower than it used to be, i would react to food that would normally not cause me so much discomfort. i got heightened sense of smell and became very sensitive to stimuli.  felt like i was in fight or flight mode constantly and very much anxious. neuropathy got worse and lots of burning in my skin, all around my torso and arms.   the only thing that helped me to detox and keep me going forward was acupuncture, but my acupuncturist and i knew that it wasn't enough, so we started me on chinese herbs for lyme.  before starting the treatment, a few things did get better which is my heightened sense of smell and i don't feel like i am in constant fight or flight mode, but i do feel like my body is tense, anxious, and very much in pain. neuropathy and burning sucks sad.  i have a hard time understanding if i am having a die off symptom, if i am reacting to something, or if i am flaring. every time i eat, i feel my neuropathy and burning in the skin get worse. also my brain feels inflamed and i get more panicky.  then i take my herb a little bit after. but i don't understand which food i am reacting to. and if i am reacting to the herb after.  ugh. however, i think i do react to eggs, nuts, chamomile tea (the only tea i ever drink), and fruits, because it becomes clear as day when i consume these things, so i decided to not eat these things.  i feel like though i am overreacting to things and wonder if this is how it is while you have lyme and if it gets better with treatment.  i am wondering if it's my limbic system or my nervous system or my mast cells or histamines or if i have oxalate crystals (one doctor said i have in my blood, but it was awhile back and i tried to be on the diet, but it is so restrictive and i felt that i wasn't getting enough nutrients). and i am so sensitive to supplements as well. hard to start something new.  fortunately on tuesday i will go to an integrative chinese medicine clinic that does testing for mast cells, histamines, and food sensitivities.  i want to make sure i eat food that won't flare my symptoms and prevent me from getting well faster. i am gluten free, diary free, sugar free.  has anyone ever been in such situation?  maybe it is leaky gut too (i do have gerd and my stools are not well formed even though i take probiotics and eat clean, also i did change probiotics and think i may be having die offs now, but that's unrelated to the food i eat, i think)?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"- you say in post just above that you ""currently have a yeast infection so not sure what that is about.""  you say in your very first post of this thread: "" currently taking bactrim.""  antiobiotics cause overgrowth of yeast / candida in the gut for any human (and likely animals, too).  probiotics before starting antibiotic are best . . . and all during treatment. time away from rx, though. to learn more, search ""candida""  sounds like you may not be treating with a llmd?  probiotics are usually not enough, though. some take antifungal rx such as diflucan. i found ole to work so much better for me than any antifungal rx, though:  very good probiotics and also foods with a good range of naturally occurring probiotics such as sauerkraut, miso (be sure it's gluten free, not from barley), kimchee if you can take the heat, etc.  diet with no simple carbohydrates from the food ""industry"" - yet rich & full of complex carbs and their nutrients from the earth - along with balance of good protein and good fats.  a very specific brand of olive leaf extract (or a brand that uses the same methods of growing, harvesting, processing) - seagate. detail:  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/1/115457?""""000000  ole links -"^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
it's easy to say 'stop eating fruits'.  then add: 'stop eating carbs'. they are sugar too.  it remains only proteins to eat: meat, fish, chicken, tofu, stuff like that.  but proteins feed bacteria!!!  in my view, a balanced diet is the only way out, when one is a lyme sufferer.  it is much more important to stop eating foods that cause you allergy or reactions (such as gluten, sometimes cow milk products, fruits and veggies that you are allergic) because they will mess with your gut, digestion...  ... boost inflammation, and then you make a perfect environment for bacterial, fungal and viral infections!  plus you get all the nasty inflammatory symptoms that just wrecks your life.  many people with lyme suffer from multiple allergies, specially food.  if you are not allergic to bananas, apples, but allergic to most other fruits, would you stop eating apples and bananas?  take vitamin pills instead? and risk getting allergic to the chemicals in pills?  there is no one single fitting for all diet. unfortunately. it would be good if there were: just follow the book, and get well.  when i'm flaring with candida, of course i avoid sugar containing stuff, and diminish carb intake.  but gluten for me is more poisonous for candida than an apple or a banana. i flare clearly with gluten, and it lasts longer than the flares with fruits...^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
i can't eat fruit because of my candida but i eat tons of veggies. my diet is basically meat, nuts, seeds, and veggies.  before lyme, i loved oreos... with milk (: no more gluten, dairy, sugar, or carbs for me though.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
stevia leaves, do a strong tea, then add the tea to anything.  it tastes a bit different than sugar, but i came to like the taste...  when you stop sugar and gluten, you realize how much we are addicted to these things. they control our brains, for sure.  once the first phase of cravings pass, it is very easy, i promise, to be away from sugar / gluten / even casein (milk products), if you have a rich nourishing diet.  no nourishing diet to go over our old habits = you crave, crave, crave... mineral rich foods, teas, soups, fermented veggies, raw veggies, whatever rich and healthy can really stop cravings after the first weeks pass.  the first weeks will be unfortunately like the first weeks after a drug addict stops a drug. very hard.  after, it goes rather easily. specially with gluten, i find.   ----------------------------------------  aren't you craving for fats / oil / eggs / nuts / butter, stuff like that?  i usually crave these when i'm fighting candida (due to toxins)....^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
good for you! our son, makes zero dietary infractions (self reinforced by touching poor health hell)and he is solidly strong and healthy again!  100% grass fed organic. no grain fed animals. veggies and fruit (low glycemic is best) and olive, coconut, avocado oil.  no gluten (including gluten free breads), legumes, grains, dairy, sugar, nightshades.  he eats really good and a lot and stays slim. a meal could be meatloaf that he makes with just ground beef and chopped up carrots and celery with a large sweet potato (avoid the skin) on the side and a heaping pile of steamed (because it is winter.  don't want to lose chi with cold food in winter) veggies with avocado oil over all. a bowl of blue berries from costco for dessert. he takes those out and puts them in a bowl first so they are just right for eating after a meal.  trader joe and costco make this reasonable- $70 a week for 3 big meals a day, 7 days a week.  when the farmers market comes we hit those up big time. really high quality and fresh and alive with enzymes and probiotics and they are very reasonably priced here.  you can get through this. just do everything you can to make your body terrain strong.  best of luck!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
we know he had / has adrenal fatigue, is supplementing for it and doing much better in this area.  he also had / has hypoglycemia, so eats a balanced diet (proteins, fats & complex carbs)  he has been treated for leaky gut syndrome.  he had the male hormone panel done several years ago and there were several out of range. his healthcare professional had helped to treat, but we never retested to see where he's at. too many $$$$ that we didn't have.  i read up on the symptoms of sibo, but they don't sound like him.  we do know he has mthfr c677t and doesn't detox well. his blood pressure tends to rise the more toxic he is. so we can kind of keep an eye on the toxicity levels that way.  he's currently off all bp meds for a couple years and his doctor is very pleased with his record that we bring along to each visit.  he does very little to no exercise due to low energy and needing it for daily living plus being able to work at his home based business.  he is gluten free and egg free, low sugar, and uses goats milk when the goats are milking.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"- vegetables and naturally gluten free foods that act like grains (quinoa, millet . . . black, red and wild rice . . . amaranth) are often easy on stomach action / digestion.  in moderation, with other foods and mostly veggies, all these can work even for those battling candida - as can key low glycemic fruits such as berries, even cherries.  vegetables should carry every meal and every snack, though. there are delicious ways to actually enjoy foods you may never have considered. the plant kingdom is vast.  http://www.pbs.org/thebotanyofdesire/  pbs  read / watch: michael pollan's ""botany of desire""  this is a real ""turn on"" to live foods.   tofu is a protein that is easily digestible and has many benefits. other legumes, too.  meats cooked more tender but - most of all - organic and non-gmo meats are much easier to digest. if cost is an issue, increasing the volume of vegetables helps round it out.  real food is what matters most - and finding delicious ways to prepare, of course. spices, seasonings and culinary herbs can make or break a meal.  http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/science-compared-every-diet-and-the-winner-is-real-food/284595/  science compared every diet, and the winner is real food  researchers asked if one diet could be crowned best in terms of health outcomes. if diet is a set of rigid principles, the answer is a decisive no. in terms of broader guidelines, it's a decisive yes.  . . .

thanks tutu! yes- paleo auto immune protocol(aip). i eat veggie carbs but not real starchy because of candida primarily.  that is interesting and great about the ketogenic diet helping your husband.  i'd say you are correct ukarry- probably no veggies.  due to allergies i cannot do eggs, dairy or gluten. i just plain feel better on the aip diet.  haley, how's it going on your diet? are you feeling better i hope?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"- always, first, every time - there is a matter of poor sleep, consider  1. magnesium deficiency.  2. inflammation  gluten, dairy, corn are tops on causing inflammation, fwiw - see the neuro-excitatory post in sleep & adrenal thread for some stuff can be in both categories  i'm hoping someone has suggested a gluten-free and diary-free diet for many months to see how that might affect inflammation in the lungs, etc. if you already are, great.  3. neuro excitatory foods, etc.  4. hypoglycemia through the sleep cycle  also needs to be on the top of the consideration list. if you do not now, you may need to eat a light healthful snack an hour before bedtime that is well balanced with protein, complex carb (veggie), and a good fat.   i got just 16 minutes of rem sleep on a disaster of a sleep test i had done years ago. how i wish that i had then had some of the detail in links below.  the sleep ""expert"" actually told me that i did not need any rem sleep and that since the noises at the hospital test lab kept me awake, & i would often just drop to the floor w/o their ""finding"" a reason - they wrote in my chart: ""schizophrenia""  so, my faith in sleep ""experts"" and tests has been tested. they also really were only concerned with breathing, not other factors. and this was before i knew that lyme was a major factor or even that the term ""hyperacusis"" and an inner ear bone issue was also part of the sound sensitivity.  in retrospect, both day and night sleep / nap tests were a huge waste of money done by doctors so very ignorant of the multitude of issues that affected my ability to sleep.  llmds are much more attuned to such matters and, specifically, if you have a llmd they should be able to help you as they know about your ""steep stress"" load and physiological constitution.  now, while breathing issues with sleep are something that many sleep experts do know about, if it's something beside that, they won't give it a moment's thought.  and, even with breathing issues that can prevent good sleep, some of that could be connected with the neurological signals that get boomeranged with lyme.  of course, magnesium and some of the other supports would be in addition to addressing infections (which can cause all kinds of sleep issues due partly to liver toxicity stress and nerve tissue infiltration).  magnesium is first thing to consider, though, as well as use of light & electronics near bedtime &/or in the bed room.  in my quest for the truth, some of what i've gathered is shared below. and many others have some good recommendations, too.  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=123746;p=0  topic: magnesium - informational links set   http://flash.lymenet.org/ubb/ultimatebb.php/topic/1/89790  topic: natural sleep & adrenal support [you can't have one without the other]  looking more at the neurological issues with sleep yet some of the apnea posts also offer some ideas in addition to consideration of a cpap or similar.  as mentioned above - but it might get lost - most sleep experts do really know about breathing issues but not necessarily about all the reasons one might occur in someone with lyme.  be sure to take the advice of the sleep expert to your llmd so they can also add their thoughts to the plan of action.  many have done well with a cpap or similar, too. -  [ 03-11-2017, 03:41 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
an update:  for about 10 days, as i caught a light stomach bug, i stopped eating kimchi.  at about day 7, i felt my candida coming back.  until then, it had been dormant since my last post above (about 95% gone, really, no diet, nothing!!).  i was still tired from fighting the tummy bug, so i didn't take kimchi.  well, skin candida got worse, as i'm on a high fruit diet.  it was not too bad, but bad enough to require treatment (which for me, is mainly foot/hand baths, daily). until i started flaring after my fruits....  then back to kimchi, since 2 days. wow. kimchi does kill my candida, i have no doubt.  improvement comes in less than 24 hours. in the night, i had literal herxes in a joint (arm). i woke up in pain, about 2 times.  now the joint feels oiled, so again, sort of symptom-less.  skin candida is again back at low gear, no more flaring, despite my fruits.  i think i'm close to end the chapter of chronic candida, about 30 years of fight, more stubborn than lyme, without doubt.  the things that are working are: 1) kimchi, is certainly a great help, daily, about 2 table spoons.  2) my diet is gluten free, and recently, i started casein-free. not sure it helps directly diminish the candida, but it helps my gut.  i just know that recently, last 6 months or so, i gained no more new food allergies, but on the contrary, my old food allergies (mainly apples, oranges, stuff like that) are disappearing, slowly, but surely.  the gut seems to be finally healing.  3) new change in diet: i am trying to eat less mixed things, like one meal mostly raw veggies; less grains but not grain-free; proteins just once a day, in limited amounts; introducing more and more cooked or raw fruits.  separating food types (like no mixing citrus fruits with grains) makes me less hungry, i feel more nourished.  4) foot baths with strong salty solution (and vinegar) is still a must, because my circulation is not good and i need to take off toxins through the skin. about once a week, or twice a week, for 30 minutes minimum.  5) vital force tech product helped me to 'move' my chi better during winter, the only time i get these candida bouts.  i do some breathing exercises too, a bit like people that practice yoga or taichi may do.  i feel warmth sometimes moving to the fingers and toes, where i get the candida problem.  6) i continue taking vit d3 in winter, taking chlorella when i need, doing the violet ray sometimes on liver when i feel my liver is getting stuck, still physically active (light jogging, swimming, long walks or cycling).  stopping casein may have helped my body too, but it is too early to say....  anyway, i just wanted to let it written here, for those with food allergies and candida. it can be frightening to have too many food allergies.  and when candida is very active, it can be hell.  i'm convinced that to turn candida to off mode, we need a side-way strategy, not attacking it frontally with drugs or candida killers. that is what i'm trying to do...  i'm already glad that this has been my best winter in the last 20 years, for sure, candida-wise.  and very glad that my allergy curve stopped rising, finally, and is now going downward. i really got afraid that i was not going to be able to ingest any fruit whatsoever soon.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
just for posterity, i leave a note here, in case what i'm doing works against very chronic candida:  morning: vit d3 + drufusan (schussler salts)  normal diet, no avoidance of carbs nor fruits.  just eating healthy, as organic as possible, as rich and fresh as possible, like always. and gluten free since may 2016.  not taking any anti-candida supplement  alternating: cistus incanus tea (biofilm breaker) and kimchi (probiotics), daily, depending on herxes or flares. i just adjust to how i feel, trying to avoid pain / herxes.   cleaning / binding:  drufusan helps, i think.  liver support (violet ray, mainly)  chlorella, about 3 tea spoons a day  bear garlic, about 3 dropperful a day  coffee (black, no sugar, with or without fresh cream, 3-5 times a day)   oils (or i get mad), i crave oils: increased butter, some omega 3, oils like olive oil,  ....some quark in fat yoghurt, chia seeds in fat yoghurt (sheep yoghurt, mainly), sometimes lemon inside yoghurt,  ...flaxseeds, many types of nuts, any nuts (daily),  ... avocado, rubbing oils on skin and lymph (1 x day or less, depending on herxes), eggs (about 3 at once, when i feel too toxic)  foot baths about 2x week: very hot water, about 30 min minimum, with dead sea salt or himalayan salt, with or without infrared (i rub a cotton cloth to pull oils from my skin)  before bed, on empty stomach: magnesium citrate, adult dose or alkaline salts (with calcium citrate, sodium bicarb, stuff like that).  for pain (nerve): violet ray almost daily, and a bit of pe1 (infrared) sometimes.   so far, in less than a month, all candida flares disappeared (or next to), shiny red spots all disappeared,  ...my dark color skin on hands and feet diminished to less than 10% of black / violet (before they looked like colors from dead people...),  ...my bowel movements are still not stable, but diarrhea practically finished  ... and my electrosensitivity is at its low point as it ever been in the last 10 years for sure.  most joints feel softer, oiled, more easy going.  if not herxes, i feel zero arthritic symptoms.  and fruit allergies, they have never been so low gear like now in the last 5 years. i had so many increasing fruit allergies!!  i'm eating apples again (not all sorts though), some oranges, and even pomegranades!   only one joint in problem: the right shoulder-arm joint, as i still get some pains in certain movements, but it got much better.  my neck has softened and got so much more movable (i didn't know i had problems there before herxes).   could probiotics in kimchi kill a 30 year old candida?!? i guess not.  but i'm writing what i'm doing here, in case candida stops bothering my winters.  one thing i learned: candida probably stays in joints and in sinuses in dormant state for a long time, before it starts to create problems.  i thought that i was candida-free in warmer months, but in fact, i was never candida-free, if these candida were actually in my joints and sinuses, just less active (or imperceptible), waiting for winter to come.   if it does disappear at least this winter, i promise i will eat kimchi in all winters for the next 30 years!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"brussels, i get your point about what you are saying, but i do think that knowing what could be what in the sx department is good to know for me. yes, i agree that lyme and any autoimmune disease can make this all happen, but i also know how gluten makes me feel.  not sure that makes sense right now . i am getting really tired and losing my brain fast right now. and mabe im not saying what i should be to express my actual thoughts.  keebler- yes on al you said. i know . i get ""excited "" very easily form all excitotoxins. it is had , or was really hard to get this ball rolling with my diet and stil is a huge challenge.  i have so many diet things that i have to watch that it is lucky i can eat at all! super duper ugh here...  my body holds metals, including iron and im genetic for homochromatosis so there goes high iron foods,  then the excitotoxins.. there they go msg- no go, and out of my diet gluten, .... eating for my blood type (which does make me feel better) and leaves coconut high and dry..  corn and almonds mess up my thyroid, so they are limited... and allergic to many foods now .  so basically i can eat nothing. pretty much everything bothers me in some way, except for cherries. and beef. and other lean meats, fish.  -------------------- ""the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits."""^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"sure, i can discuss here..  i think my symptoms overlapped, but also i can tell them separate for sure.  like your (daughter) experience i can tell when i have gluten that i get sicker in many ways- gi, depression, anxiety, etc. although my anxiety may be due to my genetics in a different way from celiac. (i have a glutamate issue too found through genetics and i don't make gaba and other issues)  i don't feel very lyme-ee right now at all. in fact i don't feel many lyme related symptoms. but i *do* have some fatigue caused by adrenal and thyroid issues and another unrelated thing going onn too.  im sorry if i sound confusing. im just trying to decipher what is what with me. so complex.  my case may be unusual in that i suspected celiac, as did a few drs of mine, before i was dx with lyme and cos. so i had been off of wheat and gluten except i was eating spelt becsaue it didnt seem to bother me much unless i ate a lot of it wihtin a few days of each other.  i had one egd and such testing and then realized i should be actually eating the deadly stuff to get a true telling- for at least 6 months.  so i started eating gluten freely for that 6 months. it was pretty bad living with it. many many sx.  then i had new edg and colonoscopy and was found 'inconclusive'. so they labelled me non cleliac. my mom and i werent' sold on that so i had a single genetic test done for the known celiac gene (s) at that time, which was about 8-10 years ago i think.  negative for celiac . so i attributed all my sx of gluten intolerance to just that along with a confirmed gluten allergy report from an allergist.  the allergeist told me to never eat gluten again it was very severe allergy. ok, well, i tried. it is hard, as you know! and i stayed on spelt becasue i couldn't give up things like pancakes and other goodies. it didn't bother me too much and i rotated.  then i got really sick when i was bitten by another tick. that changed everything . i could no longer eat any spelt or even have a cheat day once in a while any more. (i used to go all week no spelt or wheat and then on the weekend have a slice of pizza or something.....)  pretty much all grains bothered me then. even rice. i could eat no whole grains of any kind for years also. they really gave me gi upset. that was lyme (or this other new issue ive newly discovered maybe)but not the celiac.  so it has been one year since i last had any wheat or gluten . that i know of. i was pretty diligent with not eating any but not 100%, such as when i go to a party i would ask if there was gluten or wheat (since many people still have no clue what gluten is).  i would not , though, try my hardest at things like buffets or restaurants, etc... if a salad or sauce looked benign i would indulge.  about 1.5-2 years ago i had a full genetic test done and went to a genetic person. i got a call from my genetic specialist a couple of months ago and he informed me that new celiac genes were found and that i am now considered a true celiac and thank god that i had been gluten free anyway!  so now i am trying to pay more attention to what i eat! but this is harder even going this extra mile, even though my diet is so limited any way. i did have an accidental gluten in a meatball the other day!  i have been having terrible gi issues since. not sure if it is related since i still have gi issues from damage from lyme and my other problem, but i do know that i don't usually get gas when i eat food and i have been having terrible pockets of gas with constipation since the other day. sorry for being graphic.  i used to deal with deep dark depression for my entire life. until i did go off al lgluten. i did however get a ton of relief also when i went on abx for lyme. those abx really took almost all my anxiety and depression away so that i knew a lot of that was all lyme related, or from cos or somethings else treatable with abx.  so that was a huge relief.  i have been feeling depressed lately the last couple of months and not sure why . could be this other issue im looking into. could be the weather, my health in general bringing me down, etc. but could be gluten sneaking in too since im so new at a total celiac diet.  the depression i did hear takes about 6 months to leave you, so .... who knows.  i hope this answers something for you. let me know if you want more from me.  -------------------- ""the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits."""^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
many people with chronic lyme are self medicating with all sorts of things for very long.  you won't be the first.  drugs is just one type of medication people take. most of us are doing a lot on our own, even though we visit medical practitioners.  if there were other ways to treat this, we wouldn't be doing that, you can be sure!   don't feel guilty. the situation is so bad, that sometimes self treating is the only way out for some of us. as you may realize on your own...  you gotta read all the info about the drug before, and do it with care.  i'm not a doctor, but when we read the statistics of deaths by medical errors, you'll probably won't be doing as bad as them (because you'll be extra careful and study before you ingest anything,and it is your life in stake).  http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139  be sure to get binders for herxes (to clean neuro toxins that can be very harmful on their own).  i would also follow other people's advice on more natural treatments, correcting your diet (gluten free, organic, fresh food, non processed...),  ... getting supplements that are easily bought and not dangerous (such as magnesium, vit d3, milk thistle, etc),  ... because anyway, both you and your daughter will need them (with or without drugs, many people take these supplements to help the immune system).^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

looking for opinions on whether i am headed in right direction.  current condition: i'm 50-60 percent functional, still struggling with excessive daytime drowsiness, some depression, brain fog, unclear thinking.  currently doing a six-week parasite cleanse. then i will follow with buhner powder (it's an all-in-one powder from samsura herbs, supposed to take it for 3 months).  dr. nicholas hedberg says he treats lyme/hepatitis-c with silvercillin and mushrooms and that's it. so now i'm thinking i will add the silvercillin to the buhner powder and mushrooms.  current protocol: taking fulvic acid, cryptolepsis; vitamins: b1, b12, nutritional yeast for other b vitamins; d3; liver caps; super curcumin; magnesium; ginkgo. for detox: burbur/pinella drops, epsom salt baths, lemon water. diet: gluten-free, autoimmune paleo, no alcohol, filtered waterf   -------- i never got a confirmation of lyme. in 2012 i had bell's palsy, took antibiotics and it resolved. i later had two elisa tests, negative for lyme. (i didn't have time to delve deeply into the whole lyme thing at that time.)  in 2014 my condition went downhill and i retired at 59 after 38 years of working full-time . i had an adrenal crash and became so exhausted i just couldn't work any more.  since then, after many doctors and $15,000 out of pocket, i have figured out i have lyme. i am self-navigating now.  i suspect i could possibly also have hep-c. never confirmed, but i have the symptoms.

- backing up, not sure if you are gluten-free or not but that is probably very important.  celiac sites:  www.celiac.com & www.celiacsolutions.come   you may also want to avoid dairy, corn & soy for at least a month and the start back with just tiny bit of one at a time.  dairy can cause lots of stomach trouble, even if test appear fine.  http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/got-milk-you-dont-need-it/?hp  got milk? you don?t need it  by mark bittman - the new york times, july 7, 2012  and follow-up to that:  http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/more-on-milk/?ref=opinion?hp  july 24, 2012  more on milk  by mark bittman ?the new york times  sidebar: when a lifetime of suffering, medical visits and prescription drugs can be resolved with a not especially challenging dietary change, a certain amount of retroactive frustration seems justifiable.  not surprisingly, experiences like mine with dairy, outlined in my column of two weeks ago, are more common than unusual, at least according to the roughly 1,300 comments and e-mails we received since then.  in them, people outlined their experiences with dairy and health problems as varied as heartburn, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, eczema, acne, hives, asthma (?when i gave up dairy, my asthma went away completely?),  - full article at link above. -^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
no change in diet - though i do suspect i have a remaining sensitivity even after removing gluten. i think i need to get rid of the others (dairy, soy, sugar).  i have some alkaseltzer gold, but haven't ever really felt relief from it. i'll give it a try.  liposomal glutathione has always made me feel much worse. do you have a good alternative?  thanks.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
quick question. i know to stay away from carbs, sugars, gluten, etc. i also see in the site posts for following the paleo diet.  soooo, my question is...i saw a recipe for brownies on the paleo diet, using coconut flour, honey, and other ingredients. does that mean i can make it and eat it?  or are you forced to stay away from the desserts on these different diets? i don't mean to get everyone thinking about the wrong foods, just don't know the answer otherwise.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
hi everyone,  contrary to what some believe, people don't stop posting here because things are going well. in my case, i stopped posting because things aren't. i am beyond weary and frustrated.  dd was bit in '04 and went undiagnosed til '08. doc j didn't get her better, nor did h or b who refused to rx iv abx despite + tests. we consulted with c and she has been under the care of g, b psych and k neuro past few years. so we've seen the so-called best and are currently with the best of the best.  she's had a couple of good years-relatively speaking. and she's had a good week or two or three and good days here and there. but mostly, these years have been horrendous for her to say the least. she has missed all her teen years and her 20's are passing her by. my heart is broken and i die a little bit more every day.  she has been on multiple oral and iv abx combos over the years. iv rocephin and zith for a year gave her her life back but as soon as she came off the abx, she deteriorated. since then she has tried that combo again to no avail and tried the woo hoo new combo that supposedly gets rid of the beast once and for all. that was a huge fail.  she's been on herbals, done detox, taken anti parasitics, gone gluten free, dairy free, went on low histamine diet, done acupuncture, done ivig which she couldn't tolerate (cidp) and had to switch to sub-q-which she can't tolerate either, iv vitamins and glutathione, oral vitamins and probably other things i am forgetting.  she is in bad shape-bedbound-looks and feels god-awful. i wish there was a place that could provide her with iv nutrition, good meals, pt, ot, other therapy as needed, socialization, medical care. i do the best i can-provide healthy food, a good, clean home, supportive environment and i research constantly. but i am weary if it all after so many years. i have my own serious health issues that have constantly taken a back seat to my kids' needs (yes i have another one with health problems but thankfully doing ok now thank god)  i am at the point that i am ready to take her anywhere. we looked into the germany clinic that heats you up to 107 degrees to kill the lyme. intuitively i know this is not a good idea for her. asked the docs-did not get positive feedback on this option.  does anyone have positive feedback from any other place? i am willing to do anything but my god we certainly can't afford to go on a wild goose chase. we're lucky we still have a roof over our heads at this point!  thanks for listening and for any novel ideas you might have.  ** edited to remove negative comments about llmds **  [ 09-14-2017, 03:19 pm: message edited by: sixgoofykids ]^0^0^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0
mrsfarmer, i haven't taken much antibiotics, but always had a bad gut anyway.  mine was full of candida, that was the main reason i try to avoid antibiotics...  i no longer have lyme, and i do eat carbs, but not much gluten (i always try to avoid it).  i only know gluten does something to me, because when i avoid it, for a month or so, and start it again, i feel clearly the difference in digestion: it feels heavy, i hear noises in my gut...  my daughter had gluten allergy, then it disappeared, then she started eating it again. she stopped by chance, for a week, and realized she felt better. much better.  one clear thing that happened is that she had no more muscle pain after sports, and had much longer stamina than just a week before stopping gluten.  then she decided to stop it, and i realized, she stopped catching bugs in school (she was always catching colds in the last year). that stopped abruptly after stopping gluten.  so, she's still in gluten free diet, as much as she can. about a month ago, she ate it again, during a trip, almost every day. not in great amounts, but she did.  today, she's at home again, with a bug (fever).  well...  as for carbs, i never stopped them, or i feel awful. i just lowered the amount, while increasing green leaves, so that i do not crave much carbs this way....  i hope this helps you decide what to do!  congrats about lyme!!! i hope it remains gone!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"- advice that i try really hard to follow: never talk about weight with friends and family or, especially co-workers.  for those heavy and who have lyme, others just can't relate. it's their nature to blame the victim and if we understand what's going on we can drop that blame, even from ourselves.  and that goes both ways, for those puffed or not.  this society that measures people by their looks is sickening. sure, we all want to look nice and feel fit.  and there is a world wide problem of obesity, partly from the crappy products sold as food, partly as major stress creates high cortisol even for those without chronic infections -  - but, i think, also because there may be so many with undiagnosed chronic infections (including parasitic & fungal ones) who are so exhausted and grab bad calories as a life boat.  msg added to many food products make them addictive, truly addictive.  [i interjected that last bit but now can't make the segue, so, here's a little blip]  however, those with lyme are just different - for now. but what i've learned is that some of those differences have made me a healthier person, even if (so far) just emotionally.  all my life, weight has been, uh, a weight. looking back at grade school photos, it was alarmingly apparent that i had cushings syndrome (an adrenal problem, swollen belly, etc.).  mostly, though, i just felt so sick most of my life. and, yes, i do remember a rash after some of the many tick bites from my grandmother's farm.  i dieted all my youth and most of my adulthood. but i did it all wrong. huge mistake that likely damaged my body. i starved my brain and all my cells, really. no wonder i couldn't think.  now, diet is no longer a bad word but i use it far differently, more in an anthropological sense for what i eat.  i abhor diets and think weight loss diets are usually dangerous. what makes more sense is to enjoy lots of foods and many flavors as the author explains in  the south beach diet (remember diet here means ""food plan"") - although we have to avoid some categories of foods such as gluten, most of what this author discusses makes great sense for us regarding the difference between good fats and bad fats and good carbs and bad ones.  we need food to fuel our cells. with all the variety in the plant kingdom, all the herbs and spices, we should be able to enjoy real, good, food.  so, when those around be get into the topic of weight (whether high or low), i shift to talk about the pleasures of good food.  if someone talk about how many calories or how much fat macadamia nuts have, i add that it's so delightful to have such nutrients in such a flavorful design and how they have a kind of fatty acid that helps brain cells like no other nut.  when they talk about ""spinning classes"" or how many marathons they will do this year, i comment on how wonderful i feel after my qi gong session. but i also quickly shift to talk about travel, life in other countries, art, music . . . .  it helps keep me sane. i sort of choose the merry-go-round that works for me (even if it has to stay still for now).  i didn't mean to go on and on. it just that this topic is a field of land mines for most. it took me years to get my head on straight about weight talk. i hope some of my experiences will help others avoid some of the scars.  rather than talking about weight, i find it best to talk about strength - how to build strength on various levels, by various methods?  it feels good now to be able to look at it that way. what really builds strong cells, bones, muscles, nerves, brain and emotional abilities? -  [ 11-01-2011, 01:00 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

"- i don't think things necessary need to go through the bbb and that could actually be not a good idea for some things. we require the bbb to be a good guard to keep out lots of things.  still, there are some things that do and are helpful such as allicin (see zhang's book on that).  the main point i hope to make, though, is that it's still mostly the work of the liver & kidneys to filter out ""waste"" and then there is less ""waste"" that circulates and hampers the brain or the heart, etc.  1. focus on assertively & comprehensively addressing infections that create the toxic overload &  2. support liver & kidneys [key antioxidants . . . & this also includes diet, exposures to scents / chemicals, too]  i believe that any thing we take as a supplement to help decrease toxic waste should also be of nutritive value. cholestyramine is not - and it can pull out essential nutrients and leave us depleted.  while it can have some benefits, and many do well with it . . . just be aware that if it does not work for you, it may not be a good fit. it is not for everyone.   3. sleep is essential to help the brain ""let go of"" ""filter"" waste. best to avoid any rx that can pose liver toxicity issues as then the liver has to work so much harder, etc.  the activity of good sleep has its own natural brain waste filter.   4. address inflammation  (antioxidant rich liver / kidney support is a key in that as well as avoiding certain things that can contribute such as gluten, etc.)   included in liver support links. as brussels mentions it, for easier reference:  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/3/36235?""""000000  chlorella & spirulina - information links -  [ 09-29-2017, 05:25 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
sorry to know about this absurd situation...  many people are on their own for various reasons.  do you know about buhner's herbs? they do not cost a lot if you buy them bulk, and last for a while.  i would treat lyme, anyway. there is no use only to manage symptoms when infection is eating up your brain, joints, connective tissue....  another cheap way to deal with inflammation is to eat a very anti-oxidative diet.  i'm doing that now. i had lyme when i was 39 too, and my child was only 1 year old then.  i was also bed ridden. i had no one to treat me at first, because i got no positive diagnosis. i knew it was lyme because all my problems started after an em rash.  i knew i had babesiosis too due to symptoms and because i could get a short course of antimalarial drug (riamet) and that eradicated all my symptoms in 3 days.  so my advantage was that i knew they (mds) were wrong, and i was right, so i could put my head to treat myself without their help (even though i found help later).  my 1 year old child was left screaming the whole day, weeks on, months on.... while i was unable to sit up most of the time.  when i could stand up, was to make some food for her or myself, and that exhausted me for the rest of the day.  it's all past for us (8++ years lyme free).  we started with all sorts of protocols, but if i had to re-start again, what i would do is:  - get all buhner's books and educate myself.  - research all basic (not expensive) supplements that people with chronic lyme take (like magnesium, binders, vit d3, omega 3 etc).  - i would start on a strict anti-inflammatory diet: absolutely gluten free (grain free if possible), all milk product free, lots of raw food (if you can digest these veggies and fruits), absolutely no sugar, no additive, no glyphosate and prepare some probiotic food (like sauerkraut, miso soup, whatever you can) that is much better than buying expensive probiotics in my opinion.  i'm preparing kimchi, just once a month or even less, and even if it takes me 3-4 hours to do that (because i have to clean my kitchen as i use the sink basin for that), i can have fresh probiotics the whole time (plus garlic, that cleans and kills so many viruses, bacteria and even candida).  the price is ridiculous (very low) for what it gives. it has antiparasitic function too (due to addition of fresh ginger and chili pepper, that is optional). i love the taste of it, and sincerely, i crave kimchi when i don't eat it daily.  koreans eat that at least 2 x a day, even small children.  diet looks like a smooth, next to nothing 'treatment', but i start to be convinced that it is the most powerful way to treat inflammation and accumulation of toxins.  take a look into fasting too. fasting is another very powerful way of re-booting your whole body: it makes your organs start working again (kidneys and liver, specially), a sort of re-booting of the immune system.  i'm convinced that glyphosate is doing so much harm (as well as electrosmog), and people just take these 2 things too lightly.  you don't need a lot of money to avoid these 2 things...  i hope this gives you some hope.  i swear that only the kimchi above can give people the herxes of their lives. it can give you a massive herxing effect...  i never fared well with antibiotics and did my whole treatment in other ways (natural and energetic treatments).  in my case, i have no doubt that natural treatments work better in chronic diseases, because they usually involve change in life style too.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
definitively, without my roasted coffee beans, that raw diet would never be pleasant in cold weather...  also, the excess of spices makes it again 'warming', such as kimchi. kimchi is almost like cooked, because it is pre-digested, and it's got a warming effect.  i added cooked animal proteins, eggs, fish, shrimps, maybe will try mussels soon, but no carbs. energetically testing bad (all carbs!).  nice to know you'll move to the south!!! it doesn't sound ... cool!! happy for you.  i do think cold is a stress to my body. the chinese say that 95%++ of diseases come from cold.  i'm doing just 20 minutes with my zapper, and guess what happened today?  bladder infection!  i got to laugh (now that it's under control).  i hate bladder or kidney infections!!!  i was noticing the zapper was making my urine darker, but did not think there were so many toxins after a month on raw food.  wrong...  i prepared a urine nosode, on different dilutions, and photooned it for about 20 minutes. now i feel fine again, but i hate that pain and anxiety, feverish feeling.  amazingly, the whole body's lymph gets pulled out still during photooning sessions. despite so many teas, juices i took, my skin got shrunk.  an hour later, it gets pumped back, it's really a reaction of the body to photons + nosodes.  it's the first time ever hulda clark's zapper is doing something clear to my body. i guess, the clean diet made it work due to synergy?  gluten free, milk products free, absolutely no sugar, no sugar additives, mostly raw, no carbs at all, kimchi daily, some animal protein... + a simple hulda clark zapper = crazy detox reaction?  detox in many senses, as i feel my candida got fried with the zapper!  i suspect that that is what caused me the bladder infection: candida die-off toxins.  whatever, i hope i won't have to take antibiotics.  this auto urine nosode already helped me out in the past, so i'm betting on it now.  i wonder if most chronic lyme sufferers start on a super clean/tight diet, if most treatments won't start working for them?  i mean, seriously, this hulda clark zapper would be the solution for my 30 year old chronic candida? i can't believe that...  i guess that the diet is what enabled that simple cheap zapper to finally do something it never did before...  the max it did, was to help some colds, but that ended there. it never made any effect on candida or lyme whatsoever.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
the gaps diet has done it largely for me with good probiotics and no gluten. i turned a major corner a long time ago with the gaps diet. you can order the book online. godspeed!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
not cured yet, but what we have been doing for that (and other gut related problems):  - diet control (gluten free for years, organic mostly, now i'm on casein free, daughter is on cow milk products avoidance).  - probiotics (at first, in pills, energy tested; now we're on kimchi and miso, basically: real food probiotics, daily if possible)  - we started recently on l-glutamine and it does feel good (with licorice and other things inside). i do feel that it changes the way stools are formed, the feeling of food being digested also changes (inside the gut, i mean).  - we use high frequencies on the abdomen sometimes (the violet ray), to keep liquids moving and repairing some of the gut inflammation; either high frequencies or pulsed infrared (pe1) feels quite good on the abdomen  - in the last 12 years, we treat the gut with binders, regularly. binders are a must for good functioning of the gut. chlorella is also a prebiotic, and it does help us.  the gut is one of the main doors to the outside world and so, it gets all toxins from food / water. no intake of regular binders = danger.  my food allergies diminished considerably in the last months, or even last 1-2 years. i can eat all nuts now.  my daughter still fights food allergies though. new allergies do not appear, like it used to be the case. she's able to have oranges again, but her progress is slower than mine.  she has lots of problems of mineral absorption since lyme was gone, so we're still working on that too.  what about you? what are you doing for leaky gut?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
"thank you, for the feedback, lemongirl...knowing that i might be helping somebody keeps me checking the forums...  i don't believe i went through 8 years of hell and was given my life back to just go on my merry way (although it has crossed my mind to run and never look back :) ...i believe i was granted wellness for a reason, and with that gift goes a responsibility to share my experience in hopes it will be of benefit (it is actually very rewarding)...  yes, i had severe depersonalization and derealization also...nothing was familiar anymore, everything was distorted perceptually, and it felt like i was perpetually trapped between panes of foggy glass. it was an extremely disturbing way to try to exist, and was only a fraction of what i was experiencing at the time.  all of those symptoms have disappeared completely.  i believe that ultimately, whether or not i had mold toxicity in addition to lyme and co-infections is a moot point, as hyperbaric treats the common denominators of many illnesses, including ""toxic encephalopathies"". that is the beauty of it...  in other words, hyperbaric treats hypoperfusion, inflammation, immune dysfunction, supports detoxification, improves mitochondrial function, destroys pathogens, heals neural tissue, promotes angiogenesis, releases stem cells (shall i go on?)...issues common to many diseases...this is why it is so effective for complex conditions involving multiple systems.  regarding diet...i feel it is a crucial part of recovery and lifestyle...(along with hyperbaric and gradually increasing movement/exercise). when i was really ill, i had so many sensitivities, and my gut was so compromised, i was only able to tolerate about 5 foods for several years. i believe that bone broths were crucial in keeping me alive, and i continue to make and freeze soup made with bone broth and eat it frequently...almost daily. i do not eat gluten, and avoid most grains, but will eat quinoa, for example, on occasion. i eat lots of good protein and fats, grass fed beef, oily fish, eggs avocados, leafy vegetables, fruits, goat's milk dairy in moderation, etc. i recommend whole foods, nothing pre-prepared, no microwave (destroys enzymes and nutrients)...  i can send you more on diet(or anything else that would be helpful)if you would like to pm me..."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0

been a while since i've posted because honestly i've been feeling pretty well. my llmd has me off abx (only on seroquel, cholestyramine, nystatin, and 2.5 mg cortef in the am), and on major mitochondrial support, which has been life-changing.  i've cleaned up my diet (no gluten, dairy, soy, eggs, and actually pretty grain-free in general).  i am working full-time again, and able to enjoy occasional weekend activities (i.e., i no longer have to rest every minute of every weekend to make it through the week).  this year i have lost 45lbs of the 80lbs i gained while sick.  i applied for and got my dream job (now i just have to pass a physical...luckily it's something like 5 squats and lifting 20lbs, which i can do on most days), and i will be moving back to a drier climate and do work i find really meaningful.  so, that's all good and i don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth.  that said, i have some lingering symptoms, and i would love suggestions for what i should be addressing next.  i have positive tests for lyme and babesia d. (igenex), and had positive signs for bartonella including that classic purple rash (disappeared last spring). given my response to cholestyramine (been on it for almost a year), i also had/have a major mold problem.  symptoms: 1. major joint aches, particularly hands, elbows, shoulders and often hips and knees  2. buzzing/tingling/vibrating in my feet  3. very vivid dreams  4. fatigue off/on (much better with mitochondrial treatment)  5. fractured sleep (waking early seems to be my current problem)  6. fasiculations (whole body, but primarily torso) in the am on waking  7. swollen lymph nodes in neck  8. tinnitus  off and on i still get migraines, but nothing like the 6-month one i had before being diagnosed, so i can't really complain about those too much.  i have other symptoms that crop up here and there, like wordfinding, memory loss, and brain fog, but these ones i've listed seem to be the ones that i note day after day as still being problems.  in fact, joint aches have gotten much worse since ~july.  any advice anyone has for what might still be going on, or if this is just lyme et al. doing their thing still and i need to be patient, please let me know. it just feels like i've plateaued somewhat.  thank you and all my best to everyone.^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^1^0^1^0

"i'd appreciate any opinions about this case. the man preferred to e-mail so i've sent a lot of information, questions and several opinions. last week, i suggested again that we talk, so he agreed and asked me to call in the morning.  in 2000, this man (avid hunter) had a horrible case of flu followed by fatigue and joint pain. gp tried to treat but gave up when he kept getting worse. he sent him to arthritis dr.  all tests were negative, but ra prescribed antibiotics for 3 1/2 months. he said he did not take any probiotics. he doesn't remember what abx or dose the two drs prescribed and has no information about the tests.  now different symptoms have developed and same dr. says it's not lyme or ra. he's had 5 ear infections since nov, ringing in ears, sore muscles (calves, shoulders, fingers, lower back), no energy, tingling in left arm.  thursday, he has appointment with neurologist who is going to do a muscle biopsy.  he said ""the ra has treated lots of lyme patients,"" but for me that doesn't mean anything. in my opinion, he probably did not receive adequate treatment in 2000 and it has flared up with different symptoms. also, he could have co-infection(s).   my questions: 1. i know sinus infections are common with tbds. are ear infections common, too? seems logical to me. 2. i'm aware of a number of cases of lyme and bartonella and some babesia in sc, but his symptoms are not the typical pattern. any suggestions about which tbds are most likely involved? i was thinking bartonella. 3. have you heard of a muscle biopsy showing tbds? 4. is it possible the tingling in his left arm could in any way be related to the heart?  any suggestions or opinions would be so helpful. thanks!!"^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

brussels -- i tried using this for the first time a couple weeks ago.  i used the quartz touching the skin, and then machine touching the quartz, as you had mentioned more recenly. i was having an issue with one of my fingers, and so tried it on there, partly to see if it would help, partly as a more innocent/safe feeling place to start.  i kept touching my finger directly and got quite a zap each time. i got the quartz thinking really i would start with kidneys and liver, but didn't realize, it would be so hard to stay on the right spot.  any suggestions? for the kidneys, i am thinking no way could i do that other than have someone do it for me. for the liver, perhaps i could manage, with both hands (that was one problem with the finger was only had one hand).  without the crystals ... you would just touch directly to the skin? you must have to turn the power way down for it to be tolerable?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
me, i'm sorry that you have struggled with an eating disorder. i have a close friend that has been in that situation and it is tough. i commend you for fighting. it is a feat to be proud of.  i don't really have any suggestions on eating. i struggle with that as well. because i have gastoparesis, my stomach won't pump food through very well.  gastroparesis diet is anything easy to digest--no fiber, fat, raw fruits or veggies, eat white bread, not wheat,etc. basically everything that is bad for you. meats are very hard to digest, so protein is a struggle everyday.  so i'm suppose to follow gf/no dairy diet, candida diet, and gastoparesis diet.... they don't match up very well.  i appreciate everyone's suggestions here because i'm learning from them too.  love yourself. take it one problem at a time. oh, and if you find a good diet plan through all this, share it with me too.  you are a support to so many people.  sorry, this post does not contain any diet help. but know you are loved.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
here is the problem-- i used to have a very, very bad eating disorder, and when i restrict, it brings back eating disordered thinking which is a slippery slope. i don't want to go down that road again. i don't know how to resolve the problem of not feeling restricted and cutting out yeast. i went to therapy for for years to overcome the eating disorder.  i'm not making excuses, i'm being honest. i haven't wanted to post that info about having a bad eating disorder in the past, but i know i have to solve this problem.  i honestly don't know how i can do a yeast free diet without feeling restricted and it leading to eating disordered thinking. i'm open to any suggestions and advice. i *want* to be able to do it. i just ask that any responses are still honest and upfront, yet gentle, bc it's a very sensitive subject for me.  -------------------- just sharing my experiences, opinions, and what i've read and learned. not medical advice.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
sorry, i should have been more complete.  i have been in treatment since 2004. at the moment pulsing with tetracycline and flucanazole. some years back i bought a gb4000 and used the frequencies that came with it. i never saw great effect though, no major herxes. so i didn't use it for quite some time, maybe a couple of years.  recently my llmd, who was never pro rife, told me that several of his patients did see improvement using their rife machines. so i thought to give it another shot. i used the frequencies he gave me.  i did a 40 minute sweep from 1218 to 1230. i did that wednesday night and did not notice anything that night or thursday. then friday at around noon somethings hit me, what felt like a major herx. it reminded me from when i first started treatment many years ago with bicillin injections. that herx lasted around 4 hours and then i felt better.  later i posted my question here.  now saturday, i feel like crap again. also have neurological symptoms. plus fever blisters are starting up. is this like a second wave or my immune system going overtime?  all in all, i should be happy that something is happening i guess. no, no way i'm doing this daily ?. i hope to recover soon - i need to go to work on mondau - and then repeat 2 weeks from now.   i will be most grateful for any comments or suggestions!^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

hello everyone!  i was wondering if anyone here had any experience with cbd oil and if they do, any recommendations for certain brands hey like.  my boyfriend got my this free sample from gentleman's brand a while back befor with even knew i had lyme. it was he only thing that would give me near immediate relief from whatever pain or symptoms i might have had that day.  i got a new vape pen and have been trying to find an oil that works best for my symptoms.  i used to smoke a lot more often but now i only do in small dosages bc too much thc makes my heart palptitations even worse. but that's not to say that thc doesn't help me. it helps tremendously. and even more so with cbd.  does anyone have any experience or suggestions with this?  thanks in advance!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

hi,  wanted to get experts option on my meds so posting here.   i have started doxy a month back. after 48 hours i felt chills, fever and frequent urination.. sounds like herx. after 12 to 14 hours felt better.  after a week doc added mepron and azithromycin.. did not notice herx like symptoms that i felt when using doxy.. but i see head symptoms ( pain, uneasiness etc), ear symptoms ( clogged and pain some times) increased.  after taking these for 2.5 weeks i started having little bit itching in vaginal area so doc prescribed east infection medication.  i have sole feet and soles.. doc also added another abx sulfamethoxazole.. have not started this yet.  no symptoms improvement yet and because of many abx i started having gastrisis for which i took prevcid for 2 weeks.  wanted to know if i do not get herx meaning the meds are not working for me or it takes longer time for the meds to work?  was hesitant to start another abx thinking it might give more problems.   should i start sulfamethoxazole or ask doc for anything else?   could you please provide your inputs and suggestions.   thanks and regards,  -------------------- na^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
it has been several years since i've posted on lymenet.  my daughter has reached a plateau in her recovery from chronic lyme. she's been ill since 2001 and was correctly diagnosed in 2005.  her llmd has requested that she seek a clinic that will help her completely detox her body - adrenal system, spleen, thyroid, liver, etc., etc.  we've found several in mexico, but with world conditions as they are, we're really reluctant to travel south-of-the-border.  does anyone know of a clinic similar to the one on the big island of hawaii (hawaii naturopathic retreat).  any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  lymedad^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
so i've been on temazepam (restoril) 15 mg since last march. my llmd prescribed it to me for sleep because i couldn't sleep anymore at all. i wish i knew at the time about the habit formation and dependency issue. it did help me sleep but only with supplements for sleep. i would get 6-7 hours of restful sleep. overtime, especially the last few months, it has lost its effect. i wake up a lot, though i try to fall asleep after that to make up for the lost hours. other things i am concerned about is whether temazepam is causing damage to my nervous system. it is hard to tell if it is lyme (and co-infections) or if the sleeping pills can also produce these symptoms, especially overtime:  -anxiety -depression -neuropathy -burning skin -panic -heart palpitations -irregular heartbeats -jitteriness -nightmares -tingly/prickly feeling  interesting thing is that when i take temazepam before sleep, these symptoms die down and then they reappear the next day. since i've been taking them a while, it is possible i am already withdrawing and experiencing those symptoms without actually getting off the pills. at the same time, it is hard to tell because i also have lyme.  i also have sensitivities to food, chemical sensitivities, sensitivities to smell, low tolerance to supplements and medications, mthfr and other gene mutations. all these things can cause the same symptoms, so it is even harder to pinpoint. one thing for certain is that i know temazepam isn't good for me longterm and it is probably doing some damage. i wish i could taper off them, but i am scared.  i am even more scared because i just started a lyme treatment and new probiotics. wish i never started these pills in the first place! and my llmd has no set schedule on how to taper off them and they're in capsules also. my only hope is when i do start tapering off them, my acupuncturist knows how to deal with withdrawal symptoms.  any thoughts? ideas? opinions? suggestions? thank you!^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

hi guys, i recently found this site when i suspected lyme due to joint pain.  with llmd help it was confirmed and i've had it for a while based on bands. i'm currently being treated for lyme and coinfection of agent swiss/rocky mtn spotted fever. no other coinfections.  i have given birth twice since 2014 and i'm still nursing my children. llmd has me on antibiotics while nursing, but i just started them so clearly children were exposed prior to starting treatment.  i had them tested through their pediatrician so far via labcorp and the two bands positive were 41 and 58.  i'm trying to figure out the next course of action. i'm honestly upset, worried and of course feel guilty.  i have a million questions but my llmd doesn't treat children. my pediatrician is quite knowledgeable about lyme and i'm waiting to hear back from her about next steps. but what i'm concerned about is, do we treat?  these are igg bands. could they have gotten it through utero?  neither one has symptoms. putting them on antibiotics, at such young age, would it even make sense? what would you do??  i know connecticut llmd doesn't treat unless symptoms are present from what i hear. any input, suggestions, anything? i'm completely losing my mind worrying.

hi all!  i don't know if any one else is taking these tinctures (mc-bar-1 and mc-bb-1). i ran out of one and am very quickly running out of the other. i miscalculated what i needed to take and the amount in each bottle.  my dilemma is that the place i usually get these things is about a 3 hour trek for me. (drive to the train station, take the train, travel to the pharmacy) and another 3 hour trek home.  i usually pick up these things when i see my dr who is located just a few blocks from this pharmacy (it's a very long trip, i usually make a day of it)  i think i might be able to contact this pharmacy and have them ship the tinctures to me, but in the event that they won't, does any one know any where i can order these? the actual beyond balance website i think you need to be a dr to order from.  any suggestions? and if anyone lives on long island and may know a place where i might be able to just go and pick these up that'd be amazing too.  thank you for any and all suggestions!!! i hope everyone is having an amazing day!!!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

(if that's possible)  i have this chronic fatigue lately, some swollen underarm lymph glands which i have had since lyme dx in 2007 but more painful lymph glands in my neck. i have been sleeping more, rather than sleeping less and just can't wait to get off my feet in the afternoon.  i am ramping up herbs for lyme and bart: crytoplepsis, sida acuta, red root, and now adding blt from researched nutritionals, detoxing with parsley, burber and tumeric with lemon.  is there any herb that would be specific to ebv? i was on japanese knotweed for 9 months and did fairly well, but dropped it last month after some lyme symptoms started coming back...specifically insomnia and my cortisol was very low. is jpk an ebv herb and possibly since dropping it, the virus is floating back to the top?  when i got the lab report via email from my llmd, he said he wants to talk about an antiviral when he sees me in two weeks. i cannot tolerate valtrex, so i hope he has something else in his bag of tricks. even ole is too strong for me, but i might have to be open to a bumpy ride for a while. ugh....another bumpy ride.  any suggestions would be appreciated. thanks  -------------------- ""yeah, i miss me too."""^0^1^0^0^^0^0^0^0^1^0

"happy easter to everyone.  unfortunately, my family's motto is ""what's a holiday without a trip to the emergency room.""  o.k, for the past 3 days i ve heard a banging sound in my dinning room. apparently a red female cardinal likes to fly into my window to say hello. not at 100 miles an hour, just enough to say hello.  so i picked up my cat to show her the bird outside but tripped over my dog, which freaked out my cat, which caused my cat to scratch me in my neck and left hand, before jumping away.  i am now bloodied with 2 long deep scratches on hand and neck. now i am freaking out. ran to bathroom, washed with soap and water, applied iodine, then made a paste of bfi powder(antiseptic first aid powder).  i am wondering what i should do ? go to e.r. for emergency antibiotic shot ? i am immunocompremised with cvid and.hypogammaglobluinemenia. i have lyme, bartonella, and m. pneumonia. i have doxy, amox, and rifamin but don't take them on weekends because i pulse flagyl on weekends.  i am on day 8 of the longest herx to date. extreme exhaustion, vertigo, tinnitis, insomnia, gastro, total mess. if i get complications from these scratches, i wouldn't be able to tell anyways as i am so very ill currently.  should i seek medical attention or take antiboitics that i have on hand ????  any suggestions greatly appreciated."^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

"hi everyone,  some of you may have heard that i've been very ill. i was about 99% healthy up until 2 months ago. i got a puncture wound on my foot, and got what appears to be a ""mild"" case of tetanus. this seems to have activated dormant / remission infections in my body. though i had no lyme symptoms before this incident, apparently i had dormant infections.  i had a surgery to clean out the wound and the wound on foot has healed, but it is still red, puffy, and somewhat infected. i believe the tetanus bacteria has worked its way down through my foot and is currently inside a biofilm in the bottom of my foot. it is making me terribly ill.  i've read all the literature on tetanus...and i've done the immunoglobulin shot and booster shot at the hospital, but the infection still seems to be making everything else in the body go nuts.  i've done tons of things over the last 2 months, but still don't seem to be really winning the battle. i mean everything... you name it, rife, pemf, ozone, antibiotics, etc. the topical / local treatments seem to be much more useful than the systemic / oral treatments. topical use of antibiotics + dmso seems to help a lot.  i'm looking for any suggestions you may have for me. i've spent years writing books and trying to help the lyme community, now i'm asking that you try to help me :-)  i don't need a basic education on tetanus, vaccines, etc. i've studied up. i need some new, think-out-side the box ideas on how to reach and kill a stubborn embedded biofilm infection in my foot. i'm open to systemic treatments, but topical / local treatments would be ideal as these seem to have helped the most.  i graciously thank you for your help and look forward to reading some replies. thank you.  bryan rosner"^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
hi all,  i have been having tummy issues for 3 months. went to gi doc and ultra sound and upper endoscopy tests were performed. gi test came out good but came to know i have kidney stones in both kidneys. went to urologist and they did ct scan was told they are 3 mm and they will pass on their own with drinking lot of water.  friday i started having severe abdominal pain and i could not tolerate it so went to er. since i have kidney stones they thought kidney stones are causing the issue.. they put me in pain meds and sent home. after 3 hours i started taking pain meds they prescribed and i started throwing up including water. my pain was so severe than before so had to visit er again. docs ordered hida scan and my gallbladder function was 21 % and said surgery needed to remove gall bladder.  i am still at the hospital and discussing different options to see if we can wait .. they were planning to do ct scan one more time to see no intenstines issue.. they think the pain is related to gall bladder. the pain is from ribs to belly button area.. some times right, left and through out.  so checking with you to see the pros and cons for removing gall bladder and it's implications.. can i wait to see on this.. doc is ok with any decision i take since he thinks it is not required to remove urgently but based on the symptoms i need the surgery sooner or later.  can i do something to improve my gall bladder function? what things i can do before i go for surgery?  any inputs and suggestions on this are really appreciated  thanks and regards,  -------------------- na^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

the best ways to detox. i am on three very high doses of antibiotics right now and am getting checked for heart issues, so i do not want to add any other oral medicines or herbals, or vitamins until the heart is checked and i speak to my cardiologist.  tried the epsom salt bath and had horrific diarrhea for 5 minutes after. i only did one cup for 20 minutes. so i plan to try it again this weekend, just going down to 1/2 a cup for 20 minutes.  any other suggestions that others have that may have shown some progress? i am thinking the heart issues are due to an overload of toxins.  i figured this community would be a better source to seek information.  thank you!^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

carol,  since the last time was my first experience with the heart palpitations and racing in 18 months, i was unsure if it was related to the medicine or the toxins.  i started to feel much better the last few days, but then my doxy got upped (doubled the dose to help me tolerate it better) and it is back.  but the headaches are back, joint and muscle pain, and now the heart issues again. so believe i can conclude it is apart of the toxins and herxing.  i still have my echo this week to make sure the ventricles are working okay.  does anyone know if the infrared causes any problems with the medicine? i know i shouldn't be in the sun with taking doxy, but is the infrared light okay?  i really appreciate everyone's comments and suggestions on this thread.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i know what you mean dan.  but already there is a lot more interest and people participating that i thought would answer this post.  i think its great..  i would love to ba able to start sharing specifics.  i have the bcx ultra because it was recommended to me specifically by a professional.  i had no idea what to choose and figured it is pretty much down the middle and not the highly expensive but really low either and has all the options of tayloring and programing that i thought i might need.  it also has the plasma ray tubes that are the contact method as well as the foot plates and metal hand cylinders. it also have led as an option and i haee the led attachements for it. also wet pads and sticky pads. i hvae not used the extra yet. i wan0 to figure out what i am dong more first.  i would like to start out by posting a set of lyme programs i started using  lyme program (3 minutes each progamed) 799-803-640-847-1087-1112-1455-2016-2050-4320-6870  i then do  liver support (1 min each programed) 337-463-574-668-787-803-912-1862-3337-5546  lymph support (1 minute each programed) 146-346-428-596-767-982-1078-5176-5443-8846  kidney support (1 minute each programed) 248-463-522-622-658-917-1865-3374-5162  in the end i do a general detox  i will not post all those numbers but can another time too.   then i do a general viral and general protozoan in addition to lyme if i feel up to it.  thats as far as i have gotten...  i also am looking at the master lists of frequenices on the calfl site and you can download the condensed frequency list.  http://www.electroherbalism.com/bioelectronics/frequenciesandanecdotes/cafl.htm   so far i have not been able to do this more than two times a week.  each of the frequnecies on the lyme and viral and protozona are 3 minutes each so it gets to be a long session if i add them in.  i read and was told that you should use at least 3 minutes on the frequencies that you are using to kill things off...  i am just learning.. any comments and suggestions welcomed..  i could change the title of this started thread.. too.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

"this is really dumb.....  5 days ago i started b12 injections at home. the syringes i received from the compounding pharmacy were prefilled. you have to screw off the cap and screw on the needle. no big deal with that. now this is the dumb part..... i went to pull the cap off the actual needle, and when it released my hand kicked back (like a reflex) and the needle went deep through the left side of my middle finger on the diagonal (about 1/2""+). i even bent the damn needle.  since then, the pad of my finger is numb. but what's really the problem is the pain i am having in the center of my finger whenever anything presses against it (between the knuckle and next joint toward the tip). any time i try to lift a tea cup, or pour water, or use utensils while cooking, etc. if it hits this area, i get a major surge of nerve pain. like i really need this.... i mean, really.  i'm not going to call my llmd because i feel like i have had too many calls recently about various other things. not that i think she can do anything anyway.  sometimes early interventions are necessary for certain things. i'm not sure if this is one of those things. or if there is nothing that can be done and just let time try to heal it for me.  if you have any thoughts/suggestions, please let me know.  thanks."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

i'm trying to compile the most common species of borrelia that are making people ill.  which species, besides borrelia burgdorferi, do you think you are infected with?  here in europe, there is borrelia garinii, that is common.  the reason i'm asking it is to find out nosodes in european pharmacies, and stock them, because these nosodes are disappearing from the market.  it's easy to copy these nosodes either by re-diluting them (and creating still the next dilution in homeopathy) or...  ... by other techniques such as radionics or other types of copy-devices.  i'm going to visit one of the best labs in brussels next week, and will start stocking these nosodes before it's too late.  if you have any suggestions about borrelia species, could you write here, please?  i'm thinking to make a sort of mix of borrelia species to create a series of nosodes for myself and possibly for making them available to other people in the future.  in case homeopathy was not endangered, that would not be a problem, but homeopathy is endangered.  i know there are many species of borrelia, but i'm interested only on the ones that are already making people ill, as i can't make a nosode with dozens of species inside...  thank you.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

anyone have any opinion or data regarding whether florida ticks are considered high risk for carrying lyme?  quote from ilads website below (what to do if bit by tick) suggests one thing to consider is if you live in a bad area, where ticks are more likely to be infected. so that makes sense in general, but, for florida, do we think a high pct. are infected?  also, i am guessing the belief is that deer ticks, as opposed to other ticks, are more likely to be infected ... how does one tell a deer tick from another kind of tick?  any suggestions?   below is quote from ilads  there is no black and white answer as to whether or not to treat prophylactically if bitten by a deer tick. if you live in an endemic area for lyme disease, then you should definitely consider treatment, because a high percentage of ticks are infected. if you do decide to be treated, it should be for no less than 3 weeks. be aware that early treatment will prevent the body from mounting an antibody response; subsequent testing for lyme will be negative.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

i'm pretty sure i have lyme--i was hiking in a high tick area a few weeks ago, and started having symptoms the following week.  the first time i visited my doctor, she said i probably had a virus, but to call back if the symptoms persisted. the symptoms persisted, i called back, and she gave a an rx for 1 week of doxycycline and ordered a lyme test.  the test came back negative. i still have some symptoms, though they are not as bad, and my doctor is refusing to give me a refill on the doxy because of the negative test result.  am i correct that, if this is lyme, i should be on the doxy for at least 2 weeks? i took my last pill this morning. any suggestions on how to get more doxy without too long of a wait?  thanks!

holy headache... i always have a headache along with dizzy/buzzy head. it is my stubborn symptom that doesn't want to go away without a fight.  does anyone know tricks for headaches. tonights is pretty bad, but neither ibuprofen nor tylenol even touch it.  i've been icing my head, but not sure what else to do..  all suggestions welcome^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i got a response back from ilads, and one of them was a doc near me that i had already found searching online and was considering calling. but thank you for the cautionary notes about ilads.  that being said, i was wondering if the group had suggestions on what important questions to ask when first evaluating a llmd. i have my own ideas, but i will keep them for now. i do however think that they fall into two categories, diagnosis, and treatment (as i am only suspecting that i have it now, but it would sure explain a lot). comments? suggestions??^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
just had annual check-up with blood work from primary.  blood showed very high cholesterol of 357, ouch !  anyways, everyone knows lyme patients have high cholesterol (except mainstream doctors).  adamant against taking statins, until i came across this. . .  http://www.utsa.edu/today/2016/05/lymedisease.html  now i'm super confused. will discuss with llmd.  any suggestions welcome^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i was treated for ld back in 2009/10 for about 9 months total. also tested pos for bart.  recently my symptoms have been getting worse and worse. over the summer i was sick several times with strep, the flu and viral meningitis. i think my immune system took a very hard hit and encouraged whatever bugs are in me to regain a stronghold and proliferate.  i know this sounds strange, but i have the sensation of worms crawling around my brain at the base of my skull / neck. i can actually hear sounds from my neck sometimes that are hard to describe (and believe), but sound like crunching/squishing.  i am currently a university student in ann arbor and there is a 0% chance i can see an llmd - i cannot afford it and also do not have a car to drive to find one.  i know what combos worked well for me back in '09/'10, since i visited 3 different llmds then. i also have done a ton of research on combinations and at this point am truly desperate and ready to self-medicate.  the past week i was having trouble even sitting through class. i was so dizzy and felt like i was going to have a seizure. also been experiencing intracranial pressure which was gone for a long time + orthostatic hypotension.  i have a very strong intuition that parasites are implicated, mostly because of the squirming sensations in my brain and also heart problems.  by great luck i found a small stash of zithromax recently. someone was moving out of my apartment complex and put a box by the dumpster of a bunch of food, supplements and medications. i found 12 pills of 250mg/each zithromax in blister packs within expiration date.  i want to get more zithromax and also albendazole which i have been reading a lot about for the systemic parasites.  i was wondering if anyone can give me info on ordering drugs from mexico or canada, such as a reputable pharmacy. or if you have another suggestion on acquiring them please pm me.  i've looked high and low for the albendazole and only could find some online, in tablet form, for farm animals. i have never tried animal drugs but again, from desperation am not completely opposed to it. however it ships from ukraine and that is what concerns me most.  if you have any sensitive suggestions please feel free to pm me and thank you.

"hi all, i posted this over in medical, but wanted to post it here as well for all of you who are continuing to keep him in your prayers... hi all, i tried to find the link about derek and his balance issues or his mri results to post this update, but i am so tired i can hardly see straight and couldn't find it, so i am starting this new thread. derek went to the neurologist today. he went over the mri films and showed me the area (about 2 1/2 inches in diameter)where the extra fluid is collecting in the back of his brain. even i could tell that this fluid area was pushing a little on the brain...so as this is the part of the brain that controls balance, this could be why derek is off balance and falling. as a mother his mri image is frightening. the neuro said that while it does look sinister, we need to do more testing and evaluations to be sure of what we are dealing with. he again mentioned the possibility of a cyst. perhaps he has a cyst that tore, and fluid leaked into the cyst causing it to enlarge... perhaps inside this fluid is a lesion or something causing this extra fluid.. perhaps this or perhaps that... (i figure there is no sense speculating until we have all the info..) so i asked if he was certain it wasn't a tumor, and he said he couldn't say with 100% certainty that it isn't a tumor, but in his opinion he thought the chances were slim that it might be a tumor.... he then said that derek needed to be seen by the pediatric neuro surgeon at the children's hospital at dartmouth ( chad). this is the children's hospital located in dartmouth hitchcock medical center.. so i asked him where we go from here, and he said that the neuro surgeon will probably order more extensive testing and may want to do the brain surgery to drain/remove the fluid area, depending on the findings... i haven't slept in days and have promised myself i wouldn't research this on the net, as it is too overwhelming with bad news, and ""what if's"" so i was wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience? if so, can you tell me anything positive about all this?? i am trying to keep an optimistic attitude, but must admit it is hard... any advice or information would be greatly appreciated. please keep derek in your thoughts and prayers"^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

help! need advice. last night i found out my 13 year old daughter had been pretending to take meds and telling us she was taking them when she wasn't. the bottle is opaque, so i didn't realize there were so many left until i decided to do a count. there were 24 of 30 pills still in the bottle that were to be taken once a day since first of january. we had to break this news to our llmd today and he was, understandably, a bit upset. we were trying a month of antivirals with no abx to see if it made any diffence on her continuing 2 year fever. i was devastated when i learned she had done this. my daughter has no explantation, but seems remorseful. we have a similar situation with our 17 year old son. he is insulin-dependent and on a pump. he tests his glucose 4-6 times a day, but will not write them down in his log book. he tells us he has and sometimes even pretends to. we have grounded him, taken away his car keys and various privileges, we have pleaded and we have educated him on the consequences of poor blood sugar control. (we have now institued a policy that he cannot leave the house without showing us that they have been recorded.) our doctor cannot determine how to change his regimin without info regarding the carbs he eats and the insulin doses he takes. the doctor has talked to him about this many times. my question is, how can i get my children to see the importance of taking better care of their health? i'm not sure if they're in denial or just lazy or what. we have to fight our daughter to take her temps twice a day for her temp log. i record those, and i used to record my son's glucose levels, but have been making him do it for at least the last 5 years. i know when he goes to college in a year or so he won't record them at all and may not even test. i have even threatened to make him go to community college and live at home if he can't be more responsible. does anyone have any suggestions on how i can get through to these kids? i'm also thinking my daughter, who emulates everything my son does, may just be looking for another way to be like him. as sick as she is at times, i never dreamed she would stop her treatment and pretend otherwise. we have had lengthy conversations with both of them trying to get to the bottom of this behavior, but to no avail. as always, any advice or suggestions are always welcome and most appreciated!^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"hi. new here, looking for insight and recommendations for moving forward. i'll just post bullets below.  55 years old, live in a large wooded lot in new england, in the woods all the time, hike in the woods often have pulled ticks crawling on me off almost daily this time of year (and the 2 dogs) have had ticks embedded 1-2 times in the last 2-4 years.  never saw circular rash.  not feeling well the last 15 months or so.  symptoms in order of prevalence:  fatigue, weakness in legs primarily, tired feeling, nap almost daily now. can often power through it by making myself exercise/hike what ever, but maybe 10% of the time it brings me down. comes and goes, but is present maybe 80% of the time.  mild nausea. mostly early in 2016, not so much now. few days on, week or so off, then it would come back. appetite and intestinal functions all normal. ""flu-ey"" feeling.  period of earaches left side, jaw pain left side, some facial droop and redness during this period.  dull headaches often.  retired in january, started hiking 1-2 miles almost every day and experiencing right knee pain some days. arthritis like, not inflamed by loading the knee. often felt most after periods of sitting still. ""tight"" knee for a while. however have played racquetball for 40 years, still play 2 times a week, knee does not hurt when playing (but weakness is present, don't have 1/2 the energy that i used to)  some periods of dizziness and occasionally possible mental confusion, speaking issues.  some periods of temp regulation, chills, hot, etc.  most recently, left shoulder (i'm right handed) tingling when sitting still, one day felt persistent pain in it.  ok, that is all i can think of for. have been to my primary care doc 4-6 times over the last year, he has nothing to offer. agreed to a lyme test, came back neg. have had full blood panels done many times, everything normal.  so...  as i read all of the lyme symptoms i become very suspect. i am not miserable, but just seem tired all the time, and virtually every other thing seems to be possible lyme. where i live, how much time i spend outside, etc.  my wife (a nurse) suggested asking doc to put me on a doxy rx for a few weeks ??? not sure if he would or not.  i would feel better if i saw a lyme specialist. how best to find one in my area? i am also a cancer survivor and as such, i don't like to ignore anything.  and tips/advice appreciated.... lots of travel planned this year, i want my energy back!!!"^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
my alt is 52. not extremely high, but too high. it's usually in the 30s, so it's not normal for me. my creatinine is barely within normal range, and it's normally well within range.  i speculate it's either nexium causing it, or just a bad herx. any advice welcome. i take milk thistle and cordyceps, but nothing else that's would really support the kidneys or liver.  just kinda scary and depressing...^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^1^0

my doc tested vegf and it was very low, less than the lower limit of normal <31pg/ml.  i have read low vegf can cause air hunger, which i've had for years.  when i took sustained release t3 for low metabolic rate, slow reflex measurement, feeling cold all the time, the air hunger resolved.  i had to discontinue the srt3 due to development of nail retraction called plummer's nails, a sign of too much thyroid hormone, and now the air hunger has returned.  anyone have success raising their vegf? resolving air hunger?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"hey folks, most of you know that my older brother put together a fundraiser for my family this last may. it was very successful alot of you know me from the infancy of my illness also. the struggles, the doubts, the endlesss hours of researching different protocols for their efficacy in general, and then in my particular case, my two kids, and then also applying the thousands of hours of self tutoring..threw the internet, books, personal interviews with practicioners, researchers, etc.... many of you have also ordered and read my brochure, asked for my advice, and actually used it or asked your doctor (if medical suggestion). many of you also know that i reinitiated the iowa lyme disease association myself and am now on its board as the public relations officer. i have also joined the lyme disease association of story city, iowa. have met with state and national leaders involved with the fight on lyme. i have also been told by 3 doctors, two are chiropractors, one a physician that i should go to school as i am a huge leg up on many students entering med school today...the chiro's suggested being chiro/osteopath and the md suggested osteo or physicians assistant. i have been infected for over 25 years best i can figure....i have been steadily improving without a huge set back...we all have a setback now and then...however, since this last winter when i went to a physician and started chelation for metals the improvements have been more pronounced and i can actually feel the antibiotics being alot more effective. suffice to say that when i sat down with the person who will actually approve and write the checks for the treatments/expenses that are not paid by insurance....and was basically told...that i was looking even better than i did 2 weeks before....that the improvements were awesome, yadda, yadda.. that this person is now telling me that they think that i don't know who to go to for my treatment and that they are afraid that i am being taken advantage of....and that they no longer will pay for my families suuplements either. just prescritpions, medical testing, and expenses for those trips, etc. what the heck? excuse me? my ""administrator"" who openly sayd their knowledge of lyme and breast cancer and how to treatthem is limited is now an expert on what we should be taking as supplements....this person is well meaning...really they are! i love this person dearly.... but! they have no idea what they have just said to me and my family!!!!! no more chelation.... no more acidophilous.... no more magnesium..... no more co enzyme q10.... no more silymarin.... no more n-acetyl cysteine... no more immune system boosters specifically made to fight cancer... no more digestive enzymes... no more chlorella..... no more cilantro.... no more undenatured whey.... no more b-12.... (i have even supplied this person the handouts from dr burrascano and dr crist) these are a very well though out and planned dieatary supplement put together by me and my physician writings that he gave me, and the books i have etc.....specifically targeting those things that support my body by either replacing that which i can no longer produce correctly....and, also changing the differenciation factor of my wifes' tumors so that her body can identify them and kill them...thereby helping ensuring her survival...  this person has no idead what they are saying. i was given a vote of ""no confidence"". i was told that people are concerned because i was identifying things that made me feel bad, investigating them, finding a solution, looking for a specialist in that field, and then going to them.  huh? isn't that what we are supposed to do? so here is what i am asking you to do.... remember...i have a lot of respect for this person...and love them dearly..so, i know it may be hard for you to image that i need this...but, could you; write a ""letter of confidence"" for the old troutster here? please....please tell this person i know what i am doing for my family.... please let them know that even thought their intentions are well meant...that they may actually be hindering my families recocery... please, someone....tell this person what these supplements actually do for lymies and cancer patients. i need your help. please. trout ------------------ now is the time in your life to find the ""tiger"" within. ilda (319)287-6116 -24 hour hotline let the claws be bared, and lyme beware!!! iowa lyme disease assoc. www.ildf.info"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"hey everyone, thanks for all the posts, advice and prayers! we sure do appreciate it. mikayla is now on the mend!!! her fever is 99.9 and the rash is fading to pink..phew! derek is still battling a temp of about 103, even on meds. but i am more worried about the pain in his feet and legs than the fever. his legs hurt so bad, that he can't even walk! he has to crawl to the bathroom.... the doc said it was because he has severe joint pain ( possible arthritis) from lyme and that the bacteria is making it worse. i put a call into dr.j about this today , but haven't heard back from him. i do know that whenever derek gets really sick, his joints do hurt him very much. so many people told me not to worry about scarlet fever as it's ""just"" strep with a rash..i wish it were that simple!. my kids have both had strep several times and it was a day in the park compared to this illness. i have never seen derek so sick..ever. he was so sick mon and tues, it scared us all. thank god his temp is coming down..it was over 104 with ibuprophen i have managed to get the fever down to jsut below 103 and he seems more comfortable, so i am hoping he will feel much better in a day or two. the school called today to see when mikayla was coming back. i told then her temp was 99.9 and that the doc said she was no longer contagious. so technically she could go to school tomorrow, but i decided to keep her home and let her rest. she has to go to the children's hospital friday for her chest pains/reflux anyway.. plus next week is school vacation in nh,so i want her to get rested up and get her body healthy again before i send her back to school. plus with a weekend immune system, i'm afraid she'd pick up another virus or something. so i'm going to call them tomorrow and tell them that i think it best to keep both kids home for the rest of the week. the kids were out this year several times due to illness, either cold, flu, or lyme so i'm sure i might get so flack, but i do have dr.notes for all their absences so i hope they'll leave it alone. plus as i homeschooled both kids until this year, the doctor said it should be expected that the kids would pick up alot of viruses this year. about the pedi, he is a great pediatrician. unfortunately he is in a clinic with 4 other doctors, and when your child is sick, you get whoever is on call. i did call him and tell him how upset i was about the whole situation and he agreed that as we had a definite positive for mikayla's scarlet fever, that there was no need to make derek make the long trip to the clinic... i also told him how upset i was about the antibiotic situation, how i felt they were going from one extreme to another and that due to their fear that they might give a healthy child antibiotics.....that in my opinion, they jeopardized the health of both of my children who were now extremely sick due to his co-doctors ignorance. he didn't go so far as to agree with me about the incompetence of his coworkers, but did agree that it seems more children are not getting antibiotics when they need them due to the cdc's new ""suggestions"" about dispensing antibiotics. so it's yet another case of the cdc, messing with the health of our children and interfering with their health care. it's infuriating! and i also addressed the issue of the waiting room, it's a large room and one side is for well patients and one side for sick patients..only problem is that there is no divider of any kind.. and the sick kids have to walk through the well patient side before getting to their side of the room!..it's ridiculous..like having a non smoking section in a room with no divider.. i don't know if anything will be done about it, but for such a nice new clinic, one would think they would have taken precautions. there is plenty of room to make two waiting rooms.. oh well, i am just thankful that they are now being treated and that they are getting better. okay, thanks for letting me sputter again..lol! i'm going to give derek another bath to get him comfortable for the night. any suggestions on what to do to help ease the pain in his joints, would be appreciated!"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
hello all. my name is travis. i was diagnosed with lyme twice. once in 2001 and again in 2003. both times the doctor put me on antibiotics until the tests resulted negative. unfortunately, i don't remember the antibiotic nor the type of test given (actually lyme titer sounds familiar). anyway, for the last four years i have had headaches almost daily. lots of neck pain and stiffness. neither are severe, just constant. for the last 8 months or so i have developed knee pain and occasional other joint pain. i am 32 years old. i have been going to a headache specialist for 3 years and he has been throwing different types of medicine at it with some occasional, but not complete success. i am starting to believe that i might have lyme again, or possibly that it never really went away. i have a doctors appointment with my general practitioner in a couple of weeks and am thinking of asking to be sent for testing again or possibly sent to a lyme specialist.  i need some advice here. does this sound like possible lyme to you all? what tests should i request? should i request to be sent to a specialist or llmd ? any other suggestions?  thanks in advance for any advice you can give. i posted this in the seeking a doctor forum and one kind person gave me a few names that i will use if needed. i greatly appreciate any help given. i'm a little lost as to what i should be doing.^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
hi, my 8 year old son had a blood test today for lyme, at my suggestion to the dr. a little history back in mid june he had a deer tick, i am not sure how long it was on him but when it was removed it was bloody. i watched for a bullseye whch never occurred. as any eight year old he has minor complaints over the past few months which i had not thought much about untill today. two weeks ago his elbow was sore and swollen and stiff took to the dr x rays showed nothing, the swelling persisted and was told to go to an orthopedist who said he probally hyrer extended it, then on thursday his knee started becoming swollen and sore and has been limping since then, hence the lyme test since again nothing showed on the xray. to you the more experienced does this sound like lyme? i will know in 2-3 days when the blood comes back but the wait is going to kill me. i feel guilty for not picking it up sooner. any feedback and advice would be appreciated and any insight to what he may be facing would also help. thanks in advance. hillary^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
thank you all so much for your replies and especially for your support. it just helps to know that you are all there for me and pulling for me!  carol and lou - just wanted to say that i have been on bicillin im before and it didn't help me. i did it for 5 weeks and hated the shots so much. since there was no improvement, it was stopped. there's not much that i can't deal with but shots are one of them so i don't think that's a good option for me at this point. thanks for the suggestion, though!  lou - what do you think clinda is usually given with for lyme? i know it's usually given with quinine for babesia. i probably do still have babesia and bartonella but it is so hard to tell - i've been treated for both of them so much but they're nasty buggers so i could still have them. if you could let me know what you think clinda is usually given with for lyme, i can take that info to my llmd tomorrow.  lymeloco and linda - thanks so much for offering your support and positive thoughts tomorrow. it does help to know you care, even if you don't have any specific advice to offer.  i guess i'm just trying to figure out how to convince my llmd to go ahead and order the iv primaxin (to switch me from the clinda to primaxin) without being pushy. he's kind of hard to read and sometimes just stops communicating (as he did at my last appointment). or if not get him to put me on primaxin, have something else to suggest. the problem is that with my stomach being so sensitive and my insurance company usually being difficult, going ahead and getting the iv change set up might take a few weeks at least. if not iv primaxin, i'm thinking maybe iv zithro and mepron to try to hit lingering babesia? (i've done iv zithro before.) or iv doxy or iv levaquin to try to hit the bart? i'm just trying to figure out what i want out of the appointment so i can figure out how to present myself tomorrow. i hate to feel like i'm manipulating my llmd, but sometimes we really do know what our bodies need and our doctors can't understand it!  also, an interesting bit of information. i just got my labs back for this week and there is an interesting trend. four weeks ago, my wbc level was low and now this week it's low again. also, after a week off the clinda, my rbc and hemoglobin dropped low and now it's back up again. any thoughts on this?  peace and healing, annie  --------------------   lyme out retreats  my lyme journal^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^1^1^0
can't say when she contracted it because she was bitten many times over the years yet ignored bulleyes and swollen glands.  problem is, even tho she recently tested positive, she's viewing her symptoms (double-vision, weakness, depression, pain, and more) as non-related.  situation is compounded because of cervical diskectomy in march (for neck pain) which did not relieve pain. so she blames pain on 'botched' surgery.  complications arose immediately after surgery. excruciating arm, shoulder, rib, and back pain. so weak she fell to her knees trying to stand.  was prescribed many drugs in an attempt to control the pain which gave her lots of bad side effects (but in looking back, i think they were lyme symptoms).  at that time, she did not know she had lyme.  i'm thinking it was lying dormant and when her resistance was low due to invasive surgery, that is when it attacked her body and caused all the things we blamed on side-effects...  because it was those so-called side effects that ultimately made me take her to get tested.  she has many other symptoms but these are the ones really getting to her:  1 - she describes neck pain as if someone turned her head completely around (like the exorcist) and stretched all the muscles.  2 - her upper back pain spans from the armpits to shoulder-blades, but not in middle at spine.  she describes this as though someone is trying to pry apart her shoulder-blade bones with a knife (not behind the ``wing'' bone but actually within the bone itself).  3 - lastly, there's pain in one shoulder which she blames on torn rotator cuff.  another problem is, she's had back issues/surgeries her whole life as well as the other rotator cuff repaired.  therefore she's familiar with pain and just assumes it is a symptom non-related to lyme.  but with all my research, it seems it `could' be from it. what do ya'll think?  i can't seem to get her connect any of her symptoms to lyme and therefore she wants to go off the doxy due to the nausea.  and she won't follow any of the suggestions from this forum on what may help nausea.  i know it can affect the mind, too, so i give her the benefit of the doubt that she's just not comprehending things.  for example, after complaining of double-vision, i told her it was a symptom. she acknowledged the info, yet a few days later she wanted wanting to go to the eye doctor for a new prescription (she wears glasses).  she complained about having to taking the doxy for 4 wks when she'd already taken it previously for 2 wks.  so i have to remind her about the 4 week gestation period and the dormancy and that that is why you need a continuous 4 wks of doxy. that 2 wks and then a gap and then 2 more wks of doxy aren't the same. and i know i've told her this at least 5 times already.  it's like she wants to have these things be permanently wrong with her instead of knowing they come from the disease and may go away with treatment.  i don't know if, like i said, it comes from her brain being affected.  or if she just doesn't want to accept advice from me (because i'm not an md).  or if it's `the daughter' taking care of `the mother' thing that she can't handle -- or what?  so i'm reaching out to you guys for two things:  one - anyone experienced similar pain? i know there's all sorts of pain (i've read and read so much on here already). so not to be rude or unappreciative, but just looking for similar pain experiences.  two - this woman has survived cancer, many surgeries, broken bones, etc. so she's normally a positive, strong-willed woman and does not like pity. she's 82 but prior to lyme, acted 62.  she was very bright and independent so i know this is hard for her.  but how do i deal with her inability to accept what i've learned about all that lyme can do to a person?  i'm just so frustrated i want to cry.  i spend hours educating myself so i can help her but it's like it goes in one ear and out the other,   btw - hasn't yet seen a llmd. she is scheduled next month with a ll infectious disease md.  thanks so much, bonnie^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i have a friend who has lyme, interstitial cystitis, and other health problems. she is in severe pain with the interstitial cystitis, can't sleep, and it is compounding lyme and other illnesses. i had severe interstitial cystitis several years ago and know how painful it is.  her urologist refuses to give her painkillers. her llmd is in another state, usually won't prescribe painkillers on the phone, and is on vacation.  she has also tried urgent care clinics. she *does not* have a painkiller abuse problem and isn't on them.  i gave some general suggestions to her, but i dunno if the suggestions will help.  has anyone been in this situation? how did you get painkillers when they are legitimately needed for pain?

"i apologize, i posted in medical questions, but i think i should have posted here.  long post follows....i hope you'll read.  after 2+ years of knowing something's not right and dxs that span the spectrum of fibromyalgia, depression, etc... i was trying pt for chronic back pain and the pt asked if i'd ever been tested for lyme. so, i began investigating and found this group a few days ago. first, thank you for the replies in my ""seeking doctors"" post.  i furthered the question to my pcp, who has been compassionate for the last 2+ years, but still has no explanation for my pains. she gave me a quest form for their lyme testing. from what i see on this group, though, is that the likelihood of yet another negative result is high for these tests (elisa i think, i haven't yet gotten the sheet).  so, a few questions. should i even bother with these tests? they would be covered by insurance so cost isn't an issue. if i do them, is there any way to ""stack the deck"" in my favor so i get a positive and my chronic pain is ""legitimized"". the only med i'm currently on is skelaxin (muscle spasms). i've stopped all other supplements for now to see if this has any benefit. so far, minimal, it helps me sleep a little better. these last years have changed me to someone i am not and it's left me feeling sad and quite alone.  over the years, i've been on various meds for difficulty sleeping, depression, muscle pain/spasms, antibiotics for other non-specific issues and in general they all make me fill like, well, crap. i've got two kids that have special needs, as well as having dropped back to part time work, i can't afford to feel worse than i do. sadly, the pain has begun to define me and i hate it.  i've seen the list of symptoms and holy, moly, it's startling to see how many i've experienced. a couple of the more startling ones were the extreme temp swings. i'm a 38yo f and at one point i asked my pcp if i was going through pre-menopause because the only description i had was hot flashes for what i was experiencing. i won't bore everyone with the list, but i am so sick and tired of negative results from ekgs (racing heart, shortness of breath), mris (back pain and sciatica), and so on.  i want to find an answer/solution to my problems, but i am nervous/scared about being perceived as a ""whiner"" to a doctor. so, i know i need to find the right doctor if this is indeed lyme. at the same time, i'm not looking for pacification. i do not feel sorry for myself, i'm just sick and tired of being sick and tired!  i did get some pms with pa doctors (thank you)(i'm in the lehigh valley) and i actually saw some presentation next sat west of philly (about a 2hr drive) by dr. burrascano. dr burrascano lecture i already had a commitment for that day, but is it something that has so much value i should find a way to go? any dr near philly is no less than 1 1/2 hours away anyhow and some have recommended drs in md (probably 4hrs). i have found many references to dr. l.f. in nj. can anyone comment on that dr?  so, if you've made it this far, thanks for reading. i'm trying to educate myself. if this is what ""it"" is, i'll do what i need. i am very private and i don't know how to talk to family or friends about my problems. i just try to get through the day. if anyone has suggestions on how to talk to someone and convince them it's not in your head, i'd welcome the advice.  thanks again. jb"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
hello,  so here is what happened...  went there, was very scared as i am scared of all doctors, but must say nice office and the staff appeared to be rather friendly.  they do take insurance so all i paid was my copay.  after filling out some paperwork in the waiting area, the nurse then checked my weight, height and blood pressure.  then the doctor came into the exam room.  i brought with me and showed him my very recent blood work test results from two test labs.  one was from lab corp and the other from mdl.  while only the labcorp showed a very low cd57 score of 44, both tests picked up the band 23 present only.  the both blood tests also picked up the high numbers of ebv and hps.  the blood tests were done about only a week before the visit to this doc, so logically speaking i assume that was the reason the doctor never did any blood work while i was there for this first visit.  i explained to him that all summer long i did have a very itchy rash all over my stomach and chest area but i thought it was from maybe bad detergent and soaps which i kept switching on but that did not help.  and also i told the doc that at about 15 plus years ago i had experienced what appeared to be a bulls-eye rash on my right arm, noticed it from sleeping in a motel in wildwood nj while partying there with friends.  my mom back then dismissed it as that i just perhaps slept on some dity sheets and got some itchy stuff from that, since back then noone knew what the heck lyme disease was.  and i told him that i noticed there was a tick crawling on me about 5 years ago after a fishing trip in md which i noticed in the car, crawling up my leg, so i just took it off and threw it out the window, a little black bugger.  he appeared to be knowledgeable on lyme disease, and clearfly stated that i did have contact with lyme at one point or another based on my tests and the rash.  he checked my eyes, and mouth as well as listed to me breath, and felt my currently swollen lymphnotes in my throat area.  but for some odd reason we spoke not a word about coinfections though that was perhaps a huge mistake on my end.  i did tell him my experience prior to that, how i woke up very stiff a few months ago, and in pain, after being put on doxy 100mg for two weeks by a dermatologist, for an ingrown infection under my armpit, like a huge pimple with puss, then my mistake was to allow someone at work who had severely and painfully streched out my neck and then my symptoms were all set off,... the very next day, the sensitivity to light, the vomiting in the heat, the pain all over my upper body and neck and pressure in rear of my head, the headaches and the sleepless nights, blurry vision, muscle aches, joint pains, tingling in my arms and numbness at times, at times tired and sleepy, and ringing in the ears, all which lasted for about a month. (still have some but light symptomps)  i also told him that i did fall and hit my head some time prior to that, so the bad discs in my upper neck could have been as a result of that fall, and prior, or maybe due to the painful over-streching of my neck by the idiot who allowed to do that to me.  also i asked him about my slight bump on the rear of my head and he checked it and said its no big deal, just a small cyst and not to worry about that.  ofcourse i went to do mri of the head and neck which clearly showed three herniated upper discs in my neck.  so at this point its hard to say if my current neck crackling sounds (which have improved but not fully) as i turn my head and my neck pains are from the herniated discs or lyme, which we both agreed on.  i did inform him that my current chiropractor has helped me a great deal to loosen up my neck and to relieve alot of the pressure on the upper back, on my head, also had some accupuncture sessions prior to chiro (though were costly but seemed to help).  we also spoke about the horrible politics of lyme and he also disagrees how all doctors and treatment guidelines are unfortunately unproperly being governed for very short periods of times.  i did ask him about and he is aware of doctor burascanno and his guidelines to treat this lyme disease, but the doc says that insurance would not cover or allow him to do such treatments and for long periods of time as well, and that each patient differs one from another.  he did say that i had a choice of either iv treatments and oral meds, since i am not a fan of iv neeldes and frequent long drive doctor visits, he then prescribed me the orals.  the meds prescribed are ceftin 500mg to be taken twice a day (60 tabs), and gave me some headache medicine for my headached and neck pains (fioricet).  i did inform him that i did not want to screw up my liver or intestines with the meds so what else should i take, and he advised me of acidophilus and milk thistle tablets.  so i got 50 capsules of milk thistle 200mg and 60 tablets acidophilus 500 million cfu formula.  also he prescribed me xanax (which i had asked for)to help with the sleepless nights.  he wants to see me in two weeks again as then i hope he will then draw my blood and check for any changes.  the major things we did not speak of were coinfections, a diet change for me, though i did tell him i was now taking various vitamins and drinking lots of juices, no more soda and coffee.  oh and i did tell him that i smoke and occasionally drink alcohol, i was never told to stop either of those.  and the other topic we did not speak of were the ebv and the hps which i was tested positive on both tests. (perhaps we both forgot to talk about these)  so i guess the whole visit with the doc took about an hour or so and i guess it went well and as i had expected though i felt he would do more tests instead of all the talking we did.  on his buis card he writes that hes a scientific advisor to the lyme disease foundation.  i guess thats about it as i recall,  any advice, suggestions and input would greatly be appreciated.  how to take the meds and how to take the milk thistle with acidophilus pills, before the ceftin or after, the timing, and the duration.  what should i talk to him next time about and what i should ask and expect.   hope this info is of great help to many new patients, current patients, and those who dont know and are seeking help with lyme disease and their first office visit with a doctor for lyme.   thanks for reading my story and your advice...   best regards, eric    [ 24. december 2008, 07:30 am: message edited by: eric555 ]^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"some of you may recall, i've been dealing with this appeal process since may.  after 3mo of iv therapy my infusion company refused to send any more antibiotics because my insurance company had not paid any of the claims. prior to this occurrence i (and the infusion co)had been lead to believe that this was a covered benefit.  soon after, i learned that my insurance company denied the claims for 8 out of the 12wks of iv therapy. their reason was that ""the use of iv antibiotics beyond 4wks is not considered medically necessary"".  my llmd submitted a letter of appeal on my behalf stating why it is medically necessary for me to continue the iv rocephin. since then i've been paying out of pocket to continue treatment.  so, earlier this week i spoke with my hr rep about a couple concerns, one being the appeal. she advised me to contact our anthem rep to find out what is going on.  our anthem rep called me back yesterday and told me that my appeal was partially overturned. they only approved one more week of therapy (now 5 out of 12wks). she told me that i needed to submit a personal letter asking that they reopen my case and pay the claims.  she gave me a few suggestions to include in the letter. that i used an in network provider. that i and my provider did not know that there was a limit to my benefits and that we called to check on coverage prior to starting iv therapy. we were both told that it would be a covered benefit.  that there was no indication that these claims were not going to be paid. both i and the billing dept called to f/u many times after starting iv therapy and was told that there was no problem with coverage.  she also said to state that my doctor believes that it is still medically necessary for me to remain on iv therapy at this time.  what do you guys think? should i trust the anthem rep? she is supposed to be the go to person for our company. she said that she would look over my letter and submit it for me.  my parents want me to stop trying to appeal on my own. they want me to get a lawyer. i'm just so stressed, i don't know what to do.  this month has terrible for me, one thing after another. i finally got another picc placed on tues so that i could continue the iv rocephin. after being off the medication for over a week it really seems to be hitting hard (especially emotionally).  cognitively, i'm in no shape to write a letter. financially, i have to do something. my medication alone is double what i earn on a monthly basis. my savings are pretty much gone as of this month.  this much stress would make a healthy person sick.  i need your help. i don't know what to do or where to go from here. i know that many of you have been where i am. many of you are simply wiser than i am.  i would greatly appreciate any advice, guidance, or support. thanks so much.

i am trying to build up my bone density without drugs like fosamax, actonel, etc. because i believe them to be harmful in the long-run.  i've been taking strontium and vit d3 for awhile. i haven't had a recent bone density test (long overdue). but my last d3 level was above 60, which is a good thing.  i am considering going back on bio-identical hormones. i had stopped them when the hoopla came out about the hormone study years ago, which was really about synthetic hormones, not bio-identicals.  i have also read that testosterone can help build bone density and i am considering that in addition to the estradiol and progesterone.  i had an early menopause (i think it's genetic) and i am trying to avoid being a bundle of broken bones.  thanks in advance for any of your experiences, thoughts, suggestions or advice.  ps, i know that physical exercise is a good way to build/maintain bone but before you tell me to hit the gym, just know that at this point in my life, that kind of exercise is pretty much impossible for a variety of reasons.  -------------------- you gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. you are able to say to yourself, 'i lived through this horror. i can take the next thing that comes along.'  ---eleanor roosevelt^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1^1^1^0

"thanks for your reply's. here is more info. vermont medical community does not believe in ""chronic"" lymes. no doc in this state will honor an order, pass on an order, or give the infusion. as a nurse my wife found every avenue blocked. i think it goes like this..get infusion ""in patient"" medicare, secondary covers but must have a docs order. no docs in vermont will order an infusion to their affilliated hospital, the hosp. they have privledges at. so we tried out patient. get med through mail but nearest doc, her doc in ""mid huson"" , i'm assuming like all other lymes groups i can't mention name, is 5 and half hours away, i make that ride, disabled myself, every 6 weeks for last 4 years, would be need to be seen evey month, at $165.00 a visit, 105.00 dollars a week for cleaning pic line etc..and up to 200 a month for supplements. thats the deal after he made medicare changes in feb.. and if the primary care doc, here in vt found out she's doing it, she'll lose her pain meds let alone not be picked up by another doc in vermont. vna will help, but must send progress note to primary doc and medicare  we got the bicillin through the mail, and one of the visiting nurses, slipped up and reported back to primary care that the shots were painful afterwards but she was tolerating. since then, the doc makes me wait till her last dose of pain meds is taken, before she'll hand me the script for the next months supply. she is trying to get us to quit her and our health care abudsman has given us all familar numbers to make ethic complaints but reminds us that we will be black balled in the state if we do. so the doc can't drop her, but can make everything appear as if she's med seeking. biggest issue local hospital has is she was diagnosed in 1993 with ""cronic, progressive lymes disease"", however, they don't belive in protocol.  if a cancer/burn victim/severe neuro patient came here for treatment, they the family could stay at the ronald mcdonald house. pam is beng treated in the docs office, just outside hillary and bills town, in westchester ny, some of you know the doc as i got this site from his office.. she stays with my 74 year old mom, who won't allow internet, so she 'borrows' next door neighbors signal when they are online, my mom does all the driving, for the last week, and is very controlling. while i was there last week my 31 year old nephew tried to commit suicide as a baby was due (they had it 2 days ago) and he was broke homeless and his girlfriend is 10 years younger, my younger sis, believes my wife doesn't try hard enough and all, even the lymes docs are wrong. no support there. pam thought with her psyche expieirance and al-anon (26 years) she could make it. she tried to get support through mid hudson doc, for supplements, and they told her 120.00 for 20 minute phone consult...she's already been on their supplements for 2 years just wanted advice to ""tweak"" for new treatment. so, i'm feeling like i have thrown her to the wolves, she's feeling like she has completly lost all control of her life. example, new doc says cut down on chocalate, my mom refuses to buy her chocolate, i would buy her a box of her favorites, just so she could have some happiness. thats a small axample. i digress next week, they combine the orals with the infusion/injection, i guess they don't run the pic line. here come the real hercs...she will be fighting back weather she wants to or not, she gets very emotional during bad hercs and i'll have to intervene but i have no place to take her, but home, to no treatment except oxycodone we have three grown kids 38, in california, 36 in chicago, and 32 in ny. the one in ny is helping as much as possible, but can't get along with his grandmother. all three kids would help in any way, but stuck like me, as we don't know whats next.  i'm sure others have had to make these decisions, my heart says get her out of there, my medical background says treament comes first, then maybe all will fall together, my finances say retirement is already shot, go for broke, where ever that is. pams family abandoned her 5 years ago, ""delusional"", not lymes. hope that fills the gaps. sorry so long of an email. any direction or suggestions will help, and i will follow them, have been for the last 10 years. bobby"^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
hey everyone. i have probably had lyme for at least 6 years and have only began treatment 8 months ago on low dose doxy(200 mg) like many on here, i went undiagnosed for years and was made to feel like it was in my head....until i came on here and got the name of a good llmd on long island. below is my story:  6 years ago: unexplained case of foot drop that lasted two weeks and cleared up. mri, numerous tests all negative and attributed to a pinched nerve.  5 years ago: numbness left side of face, left eyeball, left shoulders, numb teeth and gums, frozen, stiff fingers, calf weakness, lightheadedness, brain fog. mri, neurologist visits, numerous diagnostic tests including lyme test, all negative.  symptoms continued with no diagnosis. when i shaved my head for charity, i noticed some very peculiar perfectly round raised rashes on my head. i also had one in the middle of my chest. got some ointment and they cleared in a few weeks.  4 years ago: extreme fatigue, continued numbness issues, tingling, ``bee sting feelings'' weight gain, depression, intolerance to alcohol, vision blurriness and spots and generally feeling that i exist as a ``floating head''  3 years ago: weakness, fatigue, numbness continue.  2 years ago: multiple episodes of feeling i am about to pass out to the point where i asked strangers to hold me up.  i had about 10 of these episodes over a few months. immediately back to neurologist and cardiologist, ekg, halter monitor tests all negative.  cardiologist said i had vaso vagal response to being dehydrated and over stimulated with caffeine and nicotine as a smoker and coffee addict.  girlfriend complained about me choking in the middle of the night so i had sleep tests done and was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (stopped breathing 65 times per hour during the night)  immediately prescribed cpap and fatigue improved. with the cpap machine, my results are only 3 incidents per night which is better than a normal person.  even with the treatment, the fatigue, weakness and ``out of body feelings'' continue. my joints begin to ache and my muscles.  i feel like i have been in a car accident but it doesn't go away. i come on here and get in contact with dr r in long island who runs an igenx test which comes back very positive for lyme, bartonella and rocky mountain.  i begin doxy 200 mg per day and improve. i start taking small does prozac, vitamins and feel better of the course of the last 6 months. i go from feeling like a 2 out of 10 to say a 5 or 6 out of 10.  last week i start getting the feeling i might pass out again and this is the worst of all the symptoms.  my hands are very sweaty 24 hours a day. i wake up with sweaty hands. the brain fog the fatigue and weakness and the ``floating head'' really are the worst.  i can deal with being numb but feeling like you will fall makes you feel helpless.  i missed a few days of abx because i forgot them when i went on a trip. when i got back, i doubled my dose to 400 mg and immediately felt worse. seems to me like a herx. feel like a 2 out of 10  i want to get rid of this and am ready to do what ever it takes. five years ago i was a very athletic, in shape guy full of energy.  i was at the gym 6 days a week and could party till 4 am. i have since put on 50lbs and walking up stairs makes me nearly pass out.  this place is a great support. any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated. i am more of a believer in traditional prescription medicine, but any advice would be great. like all of you, i want my old self back.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^1^0

i'm having some trouble with anxiety and mood swings and wanted some advice.  i started flagyl in december and had some pretty weird weeks, but it's settled down. i can now take the full dose (500mg 2x/day) without any bad side effects, though sometimes i get headaches. by itself it doesn't seem to cause anxiety or paranoia.  i saw my doc a couple weeks ago, and she diagnosed the sores/patches on my toes as chilblains. i took some oregano oil and this seems to have triggered them. in past years they would be so severe on fingers and toes i could hardly walk or write, but they're very rare and minor now. the current flare is the biggest i've had in some time.  my doc explained what these were and rx'ed nifedipine to help resolve them. i've been taking a half dose (10mg 1x/day instead of 2x) for a couple weeks, because the headaches are unbearable otherwise. it does seem to heal the chilblains a little faster and i haven't gotten any new ones. i've been taking a full dose for about a week i think.  i've been doing pretty well, considering i'm working all day on my writing but don't have a job. (unemployment came through a couple weeks ago, which has been a nice cushion.) my mood's been pretty stable since early january, but the last week has been strange. friday i felt elated, like i was in junior high school--buoyant and energized. but last night i had one of those sleeping panic attacks, and today have been beside myself.  does anybody have any experience with this? any suggestions on toning the anxiety down? it'd be great to get that elation feeling again!  thanks, derek^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

hello all!  i'm starting treatment again shortly for sky-high, off-the-charts levels of bartonella henselae. i personally think i never fully rid myself of it since i started lyme/bart treatments with llmd in 2001, or when treated again for just bart in 2008. idk, perhaps i was reinfected, i guess that's always possible.  this time, the bart is being treated more aggressively though. i'm to start taking: zithro 500mg 2pills, 1x day levaquin 750mg 1pill, 1x day rifampin 300mg 1pill, 2x day floristor 250mg 1 pill, 2x day (probiotic) diflucan as needed acidophilus (need to get from health store)  any advice you can give me for a quality brand acidophilus (or any other alt suggestion avail otc) would be appreciated. yeast is a problem all of the time and is nearly unbearable during antibiotics. i'm already on vitamin d (by prescription, 1x week) and am considering a magnesium supplement (remag).  in general, i'm physically active (walking, yoga, gym). i do have some recurring joint pain issues as well as persistent neuropathy and cognitive issues that i relate to both lyme and bart.  any thoughts about bart treatment in general or ways to help get through the herx a little easier will be appreciated; 2008 was bad, really bad). i still have to work full-time during this period (if possible) and i only have 2 weeks vacation time that i can take when a dire necessity (and not all at once). i do have lots of support: husband, sisters, mother, kids, all are familiar with this issue.  feel free to post or message me privately! take care all and happy saturday!  roxy  edited to add: i'm open to dietary restrictions/suggestions to help during this treatment period, i've read no sugars (even fruits), no white flours, no white rice. i'm sure that's not all, so if you have a post or site relating to this topic, please do point me in that direction. thanks again!

hello,  i'm writing for advice, stories, thoughts on how to help my girlfriend. after decades of problems, she was diagnosed with lyme two (?) years ago and has been getting treatment.  she stopped treatment in october out of frustration and doubt and has been getting worse. i have also been diagnosed with lyme, but have more or less recovered.  she was diagnosed with lyme in i believe 2009, but her doctors (rheumatologists and others) dismissed it and kept her on ra drugs.  when she met me i encouraged her to see my doctors. they confirmed a clear lyme diagnosis via blood testing. she's been doing iv and oral abx, plus some more out there things like hyperbaric o2 and ozone treatment.  she's paid a lot out of pocket and feels she hasn't gotten better, though she did say she had good days before she stopped getting ivs.  i don't want to get into all the non-lyme psychological things that could be contributing. i know it's her choice, but she's getting worse and it's put a real strain on our relationship.  who knows about anything in this world, but we have solid lyme tests and she was only doing the abx for a year-plus. she's been sick for at least 20 years so my feeling is she just needs more time.  i'd appreciate any suggestions on how to encourage her to resume treatment, as well as stories of how long it's taken others to get well, or at least get the disease under control.  suggestions on helpful doctors appreciated as well--maybe she'd feel better with a second opinion from a llmd who won't blow her off.  to encourage others, i got sick in april 2002. i was completely debilitated and could barely work. i found a doctor to work with me and started on nothing but daily minocycline in 2003 or 4. it took several years but i started feeling something like well in 2006.  i got the lyme diagnosis in 2009, and after abx from that i started feeling really well in summer 2011. i still have issues now and again but they're more annoying than debilitating.  thanks in advance.

just wondering what others do to keep gerd away for ever? with friends like that you dont need enemies.  i know i am so weird. alot of it seems to be caused by electric motors,,,being hungry or being over tired.  if i am chewing on something it helps big time. lately i have used hard butterscotch disks to serve the weird symtom  driving a car or pickup sets it off.  like a certain nisson versa sets it off bigtime but a small ford pickup it is much milder.  in the past i have tried every med known to man,,,none ever helped a wit. up to 4 acifex a day once.  i dont recall what helped me years ago. i always take a wal-zan every day(walgrens version of zantac)  cant tell if it helps or not.anybody have even goofy suggestions or sage advice???????  -------------------- just don^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

i am needing helpful advice related to my severely failing health which is possibly due to lyme disease. since i can't get a real diagnosis i would like to get a useful one (whether accurate or not) in my effort to secure extended care for myself in the future, if needed.  i had the tick bite with bull's eye rash in 1997. i began with disabling symptoms in 2004. these have become much more severe since march of 2011, now taking away much of my independence and mobility. bad spells have included complete incapacitation for several hours due to total muscle weakness with accompanying numbness. i have numerous other symptoms which all fit lyme hand in glove but i do not have a chronic fever (though i have had such things as a chronic sore throat and other flu-like symptoms). although i do have severe, arthritic degeneration in the back and knee i do not present with all-over swelling in the joints. since i do not have the classic fever and swelling demanded by the old protocols, i am not taken seriously by any mainstream physician. the worst of them dismiss me in a condescending tone as a hysterical hypochondriac. the best of them say i am out of shape and just need to exercise more. meanwhile, my health is failing dramatically. there is no one in my area (springfield, mo) to help in a way covered by insurance (there is a doctor reasonably close who could help but he accepts no insurance and i don't have the cash to pay him) and i do not have resources to seek help at my own expense at some distant location. i have accepted that my body will progressively shut down without my having a diagnosis. nevertheless, i will likely still need extended care (either in-home or in an institution) and my biggest question at this point is what kind of psychiatric diagnosis might be available or possible to sufficiently account for such things as an inability to move much at all or to care for myself (perhaps hysteria, extreme depression, schizophrenia etc.?). i believe i am headed toward incapacitation and need to make as many preparations for my future care as i can while i am still able. i appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
ok, i was dx with lyme and possible bart over 2 years ago after a tick bite. was on abx therapy  for about 6 months then stopped on my own because i was tired of taking so many meds.  this spring, i got another bite and found the engorged tick on my belly during the night. i contacted my llmd and he started me on high  doses of doxycycline and took it for 3.5 weeks before i started to develop a rash on my arms.  the left arm was worse from driving so i figured i would stop the doxy and did.  that was over a week ago and i have stayed out of the sun. my rash is increasing worse and  spreading up my arm and down to my fingers! i went to my walk-in clinic and they wouldn't treat me ... said i needed to see the  prescribing doctor of the doxy! they even made me an appt with him for tomorrow morning.  problem is that is over an hour's drive for me and i am miserable now and scared! the np at  the clinic wasn't sure it was even from the doxy since it's gotten worse after stopping over a  week ago.  i have calls into my llmd but so far he has not offered any help! i have even e-mailed links to  pictures of my rash to him and am waiting / hoping to hear something back and soon! any ideas / advice, suggestions appreciated!!!  edit: llmd called and is prescribing me with a medrol dose pack to start tonight until i can  get to see him tomorrow morning. this is a steroid! but he is my lyme doctor... so what  do you all think?  -------------------- bite 4/22/12 abx 5/03/12 neg. lyme pos. cpn 5/17/12  bite 5/22/10 abx 6/25/10  igm ? igenex positive & cdc/nys positive with 18+ ; 23-25+; 31+; 34+; 41+; 66+; 83-93 (ind)  igg ? igenex positive; cdc/nys negative with 31+; 39 (ind); 41++; 58+^0^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

thank you everyone.  i did do parasite treatments for probably a good year ( herbs and a few pharmaceuticals ).  i had a tissue biopsy and bloodwork for h.pylori twice. negative both times. have taken the same drugs gi's prescribe for it anyway, but no relief.  i'm leaning toward it being adhesions or endometriosis since nothing else i've tried has helped in any way.  i did figure out some (not all ) of it was myofascial trigger points in my abdominal muscles and have worked those out. i had no idea they were there until my llmd suggested it and we started poking around.  i appreciate all the advice/suggestions very much! thank you again.^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
since dd is doing so well now, i haven't posted here in a long while, and i don't visit here much anymore. i used to be on here scouring the posts several hours a day for any glimpse of hope in getting my child well. with fingers crossed, i am now thinking long term for uses of the pe1 to keep the family healthy, especially if any future tick bites occur.  i'm wondering if we can start a thread regarding the uses and suggested protocol for using the pe1 (and/or bionic since they are so similar) in regard to addressing other issues other than tick-borne infections.  advice and suggestions on using in regard to tick-borne illnesses is welcome as well (and please do post if you've done so), but i'd really like to consolidate a suggested treatment plan for other issues.  for example,  --has anyone used photon therapy for relief of migraines or anxiety or acne or fatigue, etc. what about the flu or colds? muscle aches? parasites? --what frequency was used; what mode (direct or pulsed); what length on acupressure points, with or without nosodes, etc.? --do you use energy testing to determine how to treat or some other method? --what detox method did you use, if any? --what else have you used the photon for?  dd has now been off all abx for a year with no relapse. she is finally living life as a normal teenager--keeping up with classes and homework assignments, singing recitals, play rehearsals late into the evening with back to back performances, monthly dances, etc.--all wonderful experiences from a child who was so ill and housebound for so many years.  during that time we reached levels of despair and frustration that we didn't even know existed, and i'm sure you can all relate to that. i am hesitant to say she is 100% yet, though i think at this point i am just being superstitious and not wanting to jinx us. if she survives the theater rehearsals and play schedule without relapse, then i will know she is 100%.  i vowed to myself back when all this started that once she was truly well i would be a regular presence on this site to help other parents know that there is hope and recovery at the end of this. once the craziness of the next few months settles down and i am certain she is completely well, i do plan on returning here on a regular basis. in the meantime, i can offer encouraging words or a cyber shoulder to lean on.  if you don't feel comfortable posting here, please feel free to pm me.  i couldn't have survived without this community and could only dream for the day that i'd be on the other side. i am so happy that i'll be able to give back even if in only a small way.    {{{hugs}}} to all!

dd gets very severe, almost debilitating, menstrual cramps. have any of you used the pe1 to get relief? what frequency? how long? direct or pulse mode? all points or just over the abdomen?  same questions for migraines, either period induced or just random -- all points or just on the forehead? direct or pulse mode? frequency? how long?

i'm having a down day, where i'm wondering if i'm ever going to get my full cognitive functioning back, and how to get there?  i have blanks where i can't remember the word for something, i constantly say one word when i mean another, my short term memory is shot, and i have trouble concentrating or reading longer articles.  for example, i can pick up a magazine that i read a week ago and get pretty far into it before i recall that i actually did in fact read it already.  does anyone have any advice? i'm going back on rifampin because it helped the most for cognitive symptoms, but would love any other suggestions. i'm pretty much open to anything at this point.  encouragement would be welcome too! i've come a long way in my treatment in the two years i've been treating for lyme, babesia duncani and bartonella. i'm not all the way there yet but most days i'm basically functional.  but i really miss my brain. i *used* to be a very intelligent person, and i just wonder if i'm ever going to get back there again.  i look back on that part of my life and i can't even take pride in things that i have done because it seems like it was a whole different person and it just makes me sad.  i certainly can't go back to my profession if i don't get my brain functioning back.  thanks for your thoughts!^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i really appreciate the suggestions here !! i am shocked by just how awful the msm, chlorella, or cilantro make me feel in miniscule amounts. it feels the same as if i am killing pathogens like lyme or babs . i feel extremely tired , achey , fluish, and have sore lymph nodes. i feel like sleeping forever and like a useless dish rag . it is discouraging to think how toxic i must be and how hard it would be to remove the toxins. i just wish there was an easier way .  i will heed the advice of going very slow and i do not think i can do it every day and remain functional. perhaps a low dose every other day until i die will help. yuck!^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
dear ones  hopefully you can help with some suggestions. i have had lyme and whatever else (all the classic co-infections) since i was 23 years old.  i was diagnosed at age 40, and then underwent treatment with an llmd for 9 months. after nine months my stomach and intestines were very irritated and i had severe gastritis. the doctor at the time did not want to discuss options and stopped treatment.  3 years later i had a very bad relapse with very strong neurological symptoms. i went back into treatment with another llmd and improved quite rapidly.  after one year we decided to stop treatment. but...i had one major symptom left...muscle twithing in my face and neck...  .two years later and i am back in treatment, with stonger doses of antibiotics and combinations that have included medications for bartonella.  these sent twitches through the roof, and i have developed quite a severe myoclonic-dystonic shoulder jerking, and left neck jerk that will hold. my tongue, cheek, jaw muscles also involved.  due to some potential antibiotic side effects, my llmd has suggested i take herbs for one month, get blood work done, and then we will decide the next course of action at my next appt.  my neck will get pulled to the left and back, and the shoulder goes up. i take klonopin and gabbapentin for partial relief.  antibiotics last month were: doxy, ceftin, bactrim, plaquenil....hard for my system to handle all. i take magnesium every day (lots of natural calm and have tried every brand out there).  i feel great in other areas, which is awesome, but on the other hand i am somewhat physically disabled-obviously appearance as well, but also emotionally.  has anybody experienced this and is there any advice that would be helpful? anything would be appreciated at this point.  this symptom has just exploded with the treatment, now i am taking a break and it is even worse....  thank you and sorry for the long post.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i'm finally going to get a picc line after trying almost every alternative form of treatment out there over the past few years. one of the many reasons i have tried to avoid it is due to the fact that exercise is an important part of my life.  i think my daily regimen of some sort of exercise has helped to keep pain levels at bay and keep me more functional while the stupid spirochetes were figuring out that my head was the best place to hang out. but i am losing the battle and need to treat more aggressively.  i know it is possible that i will herx so badly, i won't even want to think about any form of exercise, but i am just wondering what the safest form of exercises would be for me, if i am still able to keep it up.  do any of you have any advice for me with regards to what i can do and can't from this list below?  yoga - any safe moves? nordik track while just holding on to bars? any type of aerobic dance or exercise? any safe strength training or muscle toning exercises for your abdomen/legs? lifting or holding my active baby granddaughter who weighs 23 lbs? lifting groceries or anything more than a few lbs? vacuuming with good arm? cleaning/scrubbing with good arm? taking daily walks?  thanks so much for any advice/suggestions from those of you who have had experience with a picc line.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^1^0
this comes from a very nice lady overseas who visited california and was bitten. i've edited some of the personal info, but the rest is in her words.  what do you think she is dealing with, and any suggestions? thanks for your input. all suggestions welcome.  `````````````````````````````````````````````````  i dont know whether you remember lucy but i was bitten in the l/a in 2005 (visiting family). when i first got bitten, i was in l/a getting changed when my hubbie came in the room and noticed three big classic bulls eye rings on my back, he exclaimed what on earth is that?  i looked in the mirror and said the fatal words, never mind it doesn�t hurt so just ignore it!!  when i got back home i felt very unwell, and within 4 weeks woke up with a neck double in size, lymph glands so swollen, heart beats as rapid as a mouse, rib cage so painful with purple veinlike strange streaks across it, fever, legs and arms that couldn�t move, drooling from one side of the mouth, chronic fatigue and totally vacant!  my dr. said ...glandular fever! (we�ll say no more on that).  then came tumour on thyroid both removed, and for six year i couldn�t work and struggled to do anything but simple housework on a good day and do my level best to engage in door to door work helping people know there bible � that was my happiest time when i was out but wasn�t very often.  then in 2011 i was seeing a myriad of consultants (the usual) one was a professor xxxxx, who wasn�t my usual rheumatologist but had been drafted in out of retirement to cover a shortage of drs so i went in to see him and explained my pitiful state, broke down and told him that i was an extremely fit and healthy person but then after taking a trip to the us came back ill and never recovered..........then he asked me, were you bitten?  i said yes, described the rings on my back and then after six long years this man joined all the dots together and gave me the clinical diagnosis of lyme with co-infections........the book finally got re-opened.  i got put on cefuroxime for 6 mths and then rifampicin and doxy for 4. and he gave me some valuable advice, to take vitamin b12, coq10, and fish oils.  i did get some relief from my symptoms but sadly after six year undiagnosed this wasn�t going to be the end, as you well know dear lucy.  so, so long as you havent nodded off by now, you are fully entitled to by now, i will explain what has changed and the symptoms i have now, as i would be very interested in knowing what resemblance yours has with mine:-  encephalitic head & left eye pain usually on a monthly cycle, left eye enlarges slightly and the vision is blurry and not very good.  pain in the cheek bones, teeth when eating, and intolerant to noise, especially certain frequencies, cannot bear two voices in the same room.  lots of bone pain, neck, back, hands sometimes knees  bowel bleeding on and off  during the night, what i describe as an internal shaking in the shin bones (like theres a million tiny creatures under the skin, burning heels, and night sweats � not every night very cyclical.  swinging energy levels  brain fog on and off  oh yes that rage thing!  so, there you have it.  its just that i dont have anyone back here to identify with, the european bites and us bites are definitely different me thinks!  -------------------- www.treatthebite.com www.drjoneskids.org www.marylandlyme.org www.lymedoc.org^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^1^0^1^0
i am feeling void (and deathly ill) so again i apologize to those who are supporting me with kind words and advice, even though i cannot at this time contribute the same to 'your' posts or sometimes even respond to the amazing kind words and suggestions offered to me. if i do live through this i will be sure to make it up !'  a lot of you on here know the struggles i've been facing the past year and some do not, but in short a lyme infection i had 10 years ago (and was on this site when very ill w it, which is why i feel comfortable talking with everyone one here because believe me typing out a message feels like climbing mount everest right now)  so to get to it, the lyme which attacked my body years ago has recently (the past year) played a part in causing terrible auto immune diseases which are very quickly attacking my everything.  i will not write about the hardships i've had with doctors- primary, specialists,er. all of the 30 plus drs i have encountered have either refused, turned their back, completely ignored, made fun of, were rude, . villains. massive epidemic. they just look at you like their looking through you, hear nothing, and hand you off to the next lazy anti-empathetic doc, so on and so forth. all they do is look for reasons to evade treating instead of help. in any way. i am so angry i could scream but i'll save that for another time. and since i've been to so many hospitals (especially this past month, about 8) they have even more reason i guess.   kidneys are failing now. rapidly. i have every symptom and diagnostic lab result for rapidly progessive glomularnephritis. (yes i have presc to see a neph but time isn't on my side anymore. i can't wait, which is why i've been going to hospitals. there is one one lab test they look at which is still normal so they leave me and my kidneys dropping and dying. i don't care at this point. i've hit every roadblock in the med field this year, i feel it's destined. and now i'm too sick to even brush my hair, let alone get ready for phone calls, referrals, appointments, more let downs and drawbacks, yada yada.   as i will show you in my labs i have lost nearly half of my kidney function in a short period of time. and now i'm going through an acute rapid failure since my gfr has dropped 10 points in less than 2 weeks and symptoms have become worse with a few new ones. (i don't have paperwork from my last er visit which was saturday b/c this particular hospital from hell wouldn't give me my lab results... but did tell me my gfr was 88.

bryan, my dr. does a fair amount of mild hyperbaric therapy. he did admit to me that it seems the hyperbaric doesn't help babesia, (i take that to mean directly, obviously for some it did) for whatever that is worth...  my primary symptoms are odd nerve sensations inside my head and nose. i didn't see any improvement that i can definitively say. in the beginning, it almost seemed like it was helping.  i had increased dreaming, and seemed like it may have relieved a certain aspect in my head... but then it kinda petered out and nothing else happened.  because of the increased babesia symptoms after my first half hour dive, i only did the pressure for a while. i didn't react as badly with that, but not sure i saw improvement either?  oh, and my dr did say that he often sees some sort of improvement in his patients that use hyperbaric. he thinks it can keep lyme infection down without antibiotics. that's a pretty powerful thing to say!  i will say, i did go off lyme antibiotics and didn't crash... but they also didn't seem to be improving me either...  i hope my unbiased viewpoint is helpful... i am experimenting myself!  oh, i also had a neighbor that tried mild hyperbaric for about six months. he thought it made him worse, and quit and improved some.  i don't know! there are a lot of variables in here. i used antibiotics and antimalarials in conjunction, so maybe that's the reason hyperbaric didn't work for me. maybe i didn't have enough faith to let it be my sole therapy!  if anyone has any advice or wisdom on my babesia problem, i am all ears and am very open minded to suggestions...^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

that's the good news...  a warm hug to you all. you all are in my prayers and thoughts.   andigail   2. roadrunner  i am 100% but it took over one year!! it does happen if you listen to your doc and do what he tells you!!most important thing are no drinking,(beer,wine) resting,taking your meds,eating healthy!!  ------------------ ""beep beep""  3.oreo  it's been a long time since i got on this board and i remember when i was newly diagnosed how frightened i was of the future, partly based on the horror stories i read here. so i feel it is my duty ( and pleasure) to reassure all the newbies out there that there can be a happy ending to lyme. after two rocephin sessions ( 3 months , then 6 months) i am now symptom free since last may. i am going to consider myself cured and hopefully it will stick ! yes, it was a long road ( 2 years, and i was treated almost immed. ! ) but sometimes you get lucky and i have faith that many others will be as blessed as i have been ! keep the faith ! oreo  4. gigi posted on jan 2001  after gotten bit in 1996, i have gone through a great variety of treatments and therapies, all of which together gave me my life back, but not 100%. i kept searching for a solution, being told by my doctor that he suspects a viral omponent to go with lyme or to play a role in lyme. stac's had felt the same way and having come back pain-free from ""doctorofhope.com"", i explored it further also, checking with other patients that had been treated there. my own doctor encouraged me to go. my husband, who had recently been diagnosed with parkinsons symptoms/lyme disease, and i went to mexico for four weeks to be treated.  we are both very encouraged by our noticeable improvement. i have not felt as good in many years; my husband started to improve right away while still at the clinic, yet has a bit to go with healing of the damaged nerves. as for me, i am absolutely pain-free, my racing pulse and heart palpitations are gone for the first time in years and i can sleep soundly for many hours.  explore the above website. you can also call 1-800-770-6772 for further info. please note, the phone number on the website is not correct and will be updated in a couple of days. so dial the 800 number. you are welcome to e-mail us or call. gjgilberg@aol.com; phone (206-232-7603).   5. lymerx  ceftin and doxy together in big doses.  then suprax and tinidazole together big.  then suprax, tini, and zythromax more moderately.  all these taken over 17 months. no symptoms now. i was lucky to have no babesia. i take b complex 100 for nerves and milk thistle for liver. also acidophilous to restore beneficial bacteria. i found the natural rememdies (grapeseed extract and olive leaf) just too toxic and not nearly as effective as good old anbx.   --------------------------------------- im sure there are many more . i'll try to look lateer... i had this idea about a month ago and its taken me this long to get the energy to do .it .well imvery tired and fingers hurt. best wishes  [this message has been edited by azure wish (edited 18 may 2003).]  -------------------- multiple chemical sensitvity group: http://www.lymefriends.com/group/multiplechemicalsensitivities  group for artists. all media welcome: http://www.lymefriends.com/group/creativecorner   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lyme_artist"^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^1^0
"[quote]originally posted by gypsieslament: [qb] i hope this is the right place to be posting this...  anyway... i guess i'll start at the beginning.  when i was 4 years old i was diagnosed with lyme disease. growing up in the pine barrens of new jersey as a child, i'd spend most of my play time out in the yard, climbing trees, and exploring the woods.  evidently, a tick made it's way into my belly button, where it stayed for a good 2 weeks. i remember telling my mother that my belly button itched, and her telling me to take a bath, and that i was probably dirty.  after i kept nagging her about it for the 2 week period, she decided to take a look. low and behold, a tick had embedded itself into a crevice in my navel. my mother immediately removed it and that was that.  she didn't think much of it, since it was in my belly button the tell tale ring wasn't visible. i began to become very sore, irritable, and feverish.  she took me to my pediatrician, who being familiar with the disease, diagnosed me with lyme. i was put on tetracycline for 10 days, and that was all.  i did still experience the stiffness and pain in my knees, back, hands, feet, and shoulders, and still do to this today. the aches were something that i can deal with for most of my childhood and teenage years.  i was still in pain, but tried not to notice it (up until the past 3 years), unless i was tired.  the part that i am most curious and concerned about are the neurological and psychological symptoms.  both my parents and siblings noticed a drastic change in my personality after being infected. before lyme i was a very happy, very social kid.  almost immediately after treatment, i would throw fits of rage, was much more introverted, and cried on a dime drop.  not knowing that it was caused by the lyme, my mom just couldn't understand why i went from such a happy child to an such angry one.  through grade school i became more and more depressed, and would tend to pull myself out of social situations any time i could.  there came a point in 5th grade that i was taken out of public school and home schooled, because i would become literally sick at the thought of going to school to face my classmates.  i never knew what to say, and if i did, my words came out all wrong. kids made fun of me for being quiet and saying words incorrectly. i would flunk tests because i just couldn't remember learning the material.  eventually around 9th grade, i regained focus and confidence and went back to school. i was still very depressed, but my parents were against me being on antidepressants, so i just had to deal with it.  now, here i am in 2013, having graduated 7 years ago, dealing with the most agonizing depression of my life.  my hands and feet seize from time to time, and i have what i call 'twitches' when i have uncontrollable jumps or kicks..  it feels like the joints my spine and hips, sometimes legs and arms are being squeezed together and has a painful tingling sensation, then suddenly releases in a quick burst and i 'twitch'.  my memory is deplorable, not remembering paying rent, conversations, appointments and plans.  even worse than the depression is the anxiety. i pace around my apartment unable to calm down about the smallest of things, lay awake at night dreading going to work.  even worse than that... the rage. my rage, along with my depression, has been getting increasingly worse in the past 3 years (since moving away from nj to austin, tx).  only in the past 6 months or so, have i begun blacking out during my rage episodes. i lose complete control of all sense and reason, yelling the worst things possible at my (long term) boyfriend.  i will 'wake up' in the middle of or after an intense rage episode not knowing what i said or even why i was angry in the first place. i'm ashamed to say, i ended up in jail because of an episode, due to domestic assault.  i do notice a dramatic increase in rage about a week before my menstrual cycle starts. like clockwork, on the 21st i will have a really intense episode set off by something incredibly small.  about every other cycle, sometimes every cycle, i have excruciating menstrual pain where i am bed ridden for the entire day, sometimes 2. i have also had 3 miscarriages. always after an episode, intense depression and self loathing begins, as do the suicidal thoughts, body aches, fevers.  i'm really at a loss at this point, not knowing which way to go, and who to turn to. i feel like i should probably see a lyme specialist, but living in texas i think my options are limited. i'm tempted to see someone about being put on antidepressants or something.  i don't want to put my boyfriend through this pain anymore. he has been incredibly supportive through everything that i put him through, but i know it has a major effect on him.  but, i really want to be better for myself, too. i have close to no social life, the anxiety and depression make it very hard to make friends. i just can't relate to anyone and have that same fear and anxiety i had when i was a kid back in middle school.  unfortunately, i can't work from home, and am incredibly lonely. each month my symptoms seem to get worse.  i guess at this point i'm looking for advice as to what i can do for treatment. i don't really know if i was treated long enough when i was first diagnosed, or the symptoms are just resurfacing, as i've read they sometimes do.  i have noticed an increase in memory loss, aches and pains, and much longer recovery time if i get sick.  i often feel like i have a fever and am fatigued at the end of the day (i only work 6 hour days and mostly at a desk). the fever is rarely above 99 degrees, though.  are antidepressants the way to go? or should i focus more on diet? is the disease resurfacing? or was it really never treated correctly to begin with?  i just want to feel normal again. i want my boyfriend to not have to walk on eggshells in fear that i'm going to blow up. i want to have friends again. i don't want to go to sleep as soon as i get home from work. i want a happy life.  thanks for taking the time to read this. any feedback is greatly appreciated.  ..................................................  breaking this into fewer lines at a time for easier reading for many people here.  i think you clearly need lyme treatment! so, i think you need to be talking with folks about your options, as in how close any doctors are, how much it costs, etc. there are several tx support groups listed with support groups at the left - click on united states and texas.  you were not treated enough. none of this is your fault. you have an illness. when you get adequate treatment, your symptoms will go down. it is possible to regain more of a normal life.  i see it happen all the time at support groups - people come to the group pretty sick, and after some treatment, their lives start to turn around.  i see some folks have made suggestions for do-it-yourself treatments, also that you work at a healthfood store.  my opinion is that in the beginning, it's easiest to get initially oriented by seeing an experienced lyme-treating doctor who can also bloodtest you and figure out your specifics with you.  but if you can't, there are many who are doing it themselves, with herbs and supplements. many are taking buhner herbs - see ""healing lyme"" by stephen buhner. and he's only one of many practitioners that people are trying natural protocols.  since you have access to supplements at your healthfood store, that may help a lot.  treatment falls in three categories: kill/deter the organisms, detox, and fortify the body. you can use the search function at the top of the page here to type in any word or phrase and archived

if you have a port, or have had one, or you know about it: how long can it last?  i had heard that it can last 8 years, if you take care of it well. i will have had mine for 6 years this coming august. i've tried to take really good care of it. i want it to last a good long while more, if possible.  mine is small, close to a pediatric size with a small area to access it (put a new needle in), so the needle sticks are all in that small area.  lately, it has been sluggish, and cathflo has helped twice (an enzyme that it injected to break up any fibrin sheaths that have developed). but even so, it is still sluggish, but useable. i still get a good blood return.  then, today, i had to use a gravity pole, instead of the the pump that i was using, for my ivig. without the pump to push the thick ivig fluid, it was taking about 6 hours, instead of 4 hours, because  it would only go in very slowly, regardless of having the flow regulator all the way open, and sitting down or lying down.  i am hoping that it will last a good long while yet, as i'm certainly not through needing it. but i'm wondering about it.  i don't think that there is anything more that i can do, but if you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know.  i just googled it, and it said that a chest port should last for 2,000 needle sticks. i have only had a fraction of that, once weekly on average. some sites said 2-6 years. one person said that they'd had it for 11 years.  thank you.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

starting the buhner bart protocol & have all of the recommended extracts and supplements from his book.  the instruction for all of the extracts listed is to take them each three times per day for 30 days (i recognize that this time period will likely be longer).  can i just combine the extracts (proportionately, of course) into one or a few bottles and utilize this for the three dosages each day?  meaning - calculate out how much of each herbal tincture is needed for say, 30 days, and combine into one larger bottle, taking the combined dosage each time?  or is there some reason why these should stay separate?  i did not see anything about that in his book but maybe i missed something?  trying to make this as easy as possible so that it's simple to take the doses. any suggestions are welcome!  thanks, danielle  ..............................................

hi all. so, i'm wondering/suspecting that i'm having some heart symptoms and would like feedback. recently, my heart has been racing off and on and pounding throughout my body (like i can feel my heart pound through my whole body). it's done this before, but not as intensely or as frequently.  i also have occasional pain in that area. however, i have cystic breast tissue and fibromyalgia-like pain that gets really tender in that area. i don't know if it is my heart or cystic breast tissue/fibro-like pain. it isn't severe pain and it is sporadic.  i started iv rocephin again recently and these symptoms seemed to have really increased after i started the rocephin again.  the other day, it felt like my heart was fluttering/vibrating every now and then, but then i wondered if maybe it was the breast muscle above it. i've never had whatever happened happen before. it was a very bizarre thing.  today, i've had a really hard time catching my breath and have become short of breath really easily.  i don't know what to make of this. i'm 38 and all heart tests have been fine in the past.  thoughts? suggestions?  thank you^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i have no money (on disability, nothing left after bills), so i'm trying to identify ways to detox that won't cost much. even epsom salt will get pricey if i have to use a couple of cups or so at a time.  i'm going to borrow the ~$60/mo it will cost to do bvt (i can't afford doctors, meds, etc.), and i'm wondering how low i can keep the cost of detoxing so i can maybe borrow that, too.  suggestions?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
hi all,  i am writing to you a day after a hospitalization due to methemoglobinanemia (induced by an antibiotic dapsone--> lack of oxygen to cells). not fun. for some, this drug seems to be helpful but i guess my body couldn't take it. plus my local lab screwed up and didn't monitor my levels properly, which ultimately led to this mess.  here's my story: i was misdiagnosed from july 2013 (at 20 years old) up til late march 2016, with ~ 3 years of symptoms of lyme prior to proper testing and treatment.  it started with me feeling weaker and less alert. my symptoms only grew from there and now include terrible brain fog (reading is difficult, expressing myself through writing is difficult, simple math becomes nearly impossible, analyzing a graph or anything at all is a tremendous undertaking yielding minimal results, spelling doesn't work out so well), memory and word recall issues, depersonalization, severe and constant cracking and stiffness of joints (back, neck mainly), widespread pains and aches/physical fatigue and burnout, overall body discomfort and lack of stamina/energy that one should have in their early twenties, chronic migrating itching and burning and some air hunger. i was a great student at columbia, had a great job lined up and now i can barely do anything. i've had to put work on hold indefinitely and each day is almost pure torture.  i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia (18/18 trigger points) and then chronic fatigue in 2014. i've tried tons of drugs, physical therapy, chiropractic, yoga, meditation, massage, my diet has been radically clean and healthy (gluten free, dairy free, alcohol free, added-sugar free, red meat free, caffeine free), and nothing has helped me gain a real improvement.  i started a lyme protocol under dr. h in late march 2016 (rotating between drugs- now on rifampin, plaquenil, nystatin, omnicef (pulsing 3x weekly), zythromax (taking 4x weekly), ldn etc and also doing the extended herbal buhner protocol etc. i have recently introduced detoxing supplements and activities like ir saunas and enemas etc. every day is just medications and activities to minimize suffering. i haven't found anything to bring about a sustainable improvement in years.  on the lyme protocol so far, i have not felt any better, only worse. i was wondering if anyone here at any suggestions/ experiences they would like to share.  for the late disseminated folks who got treated many years after onset of symptoms, what was your healing trajectory like?  what's worked for you and what was the timeline?  any thoughts on ldi, rifing, and hyperbaric treatments or anything else?  thanks a ton, melz  [ 07-11-2016, 08:06 pm: message edited by: melz ]  -------------------- melz^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

to be blunt,  my bowels are so slow that i back up, then it takes me days to figure out how to get it all out without having to starve myself.  i had gastric bypass in 2003, so even partial digestion of my food is a huge issue even before lyme.  histamine intolerance is also a huge issue for me. histamine foods also cause my tinnitus to go out of control. fermented foods are out.  taking betaine conflicts with a medication i am on to treat lyme.  most digestive aid type foods/supplements are in conflict with histamine intolerance.  been working hard at lowering pain medication and changing up my diet to address most of these issues, but i am currently lost.  ideas and suggestions? i keep on asking 'professionals' but they have no clue about histamine intolerance.  thanks!  -ede^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

i went to a rheumatologist a week ago and had a check up. i have been treated for lyme disease for five years on various antibiotics and none of them have helped. treated for coinfections. i wanted to see if there is anything else j could have besides lyme.  the rheumatologist said i have hyper mobility syndrome. it means my joints are really flexible and so they cause pain. i think it is similar to ehlers danlos.  it makes sense because my hands are really flexible and my knees are too. i think it is also associated with chronic fatigue syndrome.  i read about it online though and there doesn't seem to be a cure for it and the only treatment is aleve and nsaids so even if i do have it i guess it's no better than a diagnosis of lyme. so just wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions.  i had a western blot five years ago where i think 23 showed up in igm and 30 and 41 showed up igg.  i just don't know if lyme is causing these problems for me because i had no response to antibiotics  ..........................................

"this is going to be long.....  my mom has lots of immune system issues. she has hashimotos, positive test for bartonella,  we strongly suspect lyme even though, she has never tested positive and diabetes.  she had breast cancer 3 years ago - is in remission now.  her candida levels are 89 (range should be 0-2).  she suffers from chronic sinus infections. she had allergy testing done and everything came back positive.  her dr (who i have zero faith in) wants her to have allergy shots.  my son and i also both had allergy testing done before we discovered the real culprit and we both also tested positive for everything.  our allergist said he felt something else was going on to trigger such strong reactions to everything.  we treated for lyme and co-infections once we found them and our ""allergies"" got better.  i am so very worried about my mom. i don't think her real issue is allergies and i'm beside myself with worry about what these allergy shots may do to her.  we know her candida is very high and that chronic sinus infections are a symptom of that.  they had their house treated for mold a few months ago. it was non-toxic mold and they were allowed to remain in their house the whole time.  can anyone share their experiences of allergy shots?  or if you had chronic sinus infections that cleared with candida treatment? or what finally helped you with the chronic infections?  i'm very open to any thoughts or suggestions.  my mom is tired of being sick for so long, i get that - all of us here understand that, but i'm concerned her choices will make things even worse.  we here are all too familiar with things not really being what they seem. her dr is not lyme literate by the way.....  thank you for reading through all of this and for your thoughts."^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"my ""roaming arthritis"" has come back after several years of leaving me alone. so far it only affects small joints -- fingers and toes. i've tried aspercreme, icyhot lidocaine cream, and capzasin, all with no relief. does anyone have other suggestions?"^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
struggling with these two symptoms recently, in addition to migraines on top of it all.  am re-starting rifampin, saw other posts that suggest this might be bart?  anyone have any suggestions for symptom relief as i ramp up meds?  thanks.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
thank you so much all.  we are waiting for our appointment on 27th. my daughter seems doing okay but i don't know.  i will ask for co-infection tests to be done to the llmd.i don't know what should i ask he.i have lists of things to ask her but if you any suggestions please help me.  i was giving her probiotic to my daughter while she was on abx.  she was off since oct 8th so i stopped giving her probiotic but still giving her multivitamin , vitamin d,c and omega fish oil.   thank you so much again.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i am sure i am battling a severe case of candida.  i am having bad reflux and need to do something.  i don't want to take a ppi i fear of making my yeast worse.  any suggestions to help this reflux.  i am avoiding greasy foods,carbination,colas,coffee,cocoa,etc.  thank you^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^1^0
i'm pretty sure that most you mentioned i haven't heard or seen on lyme info before.  it's that or i'm just not recalling. by the grace of god the brain fog is not near as bad as four months agou.  i just want my body to get in gear. i used to be active, not meaning running, jumping etc.  dancing, horses, swimming , now the water in pools make me fell creepy.   any more bart suggestions?  tf, your program that worked sounds great but dr. is iffy about me taling it i had so weird pulling in my heal once when on it. that was after i had taken that family of meds of and on for years.  other ideas, abart and ababs gave me a herx with only two drops each. you'd think by now my body would herx hard.   why would it?????????^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
notti, thanks for asking.  unfortunately she is not doing well. she's been  in the hospital for 2 weeks. her platelet count  is 2. they want to move her to hopkins, but  because of her platelets so low are afraid if a  blood vessel would break in her brain during  transport, she would die. she was in the process  of trying to see a llmd, but she ended up in the  hospital where of course there are no llmd's. so  i don't think she'll improve if a llmd doesn't  get involved.  i'm not sure how to go about getting a llmd  involved when she never quite got in to see one  to get the ball rolling, any suggestions? thanks  again.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
ugh i have the same. does that really prevent us from getting better ? i have the same concern.. any suggestions people ?!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
oh no. i have cavitations showing up under my crowns (bio feedback). i'm not sure what to do, who to see. does anyone have any suggestions? i'm in the ne but will travel for a good doc.  also, does ozone work?  -------------------- --keep an open mind about everything. also, remember to visit activism (we can change things together).^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
so my llmd finally realized i need more aggressive treatment then oral abx. so she took my blood work again to try and receive a more positive test result so that insurance can approve iv treatment.  she mentioned to me that iv treatment is a process as far as getting it approved. for those of you that had iv.. how long did it take you to get approved?  also, right now i am on tindamax, rifampin, and doxy. i feel my bartonella is acting out in crazy ways. even with my klonopin. my anxiety feels out of control. has anyone experienced this with bartonella? like an increase in anxiety while treating it?  apparently rifampin hits bartonella hard so im hoping this is all part of the die off and won't last too long =( i also think rifampin is messing with my hormones.. my insomnia is terrible and i'm gaining weight. sorry, i know i'm all over the place but if anyone has any suggestions or has  experienced what i'm going through id greatly appreciate any input. id mainly like to know how long it takes to get an iv approved!^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
my llmd recommended a low histamine diet. i know i should do a candida free diet due to candida overgrowth. i'm already gluten and casein free.  i typed a list of the food i can eat after i cross-referenced the low histamine and candida free diets. the list is minuscule at best.  also, from what i've read, you aren't supposed to eat leftovers and are supposed to cook fresh food daily on the low histamine diet. i don't know how i would do this while still working--even if i wasn't working it would be tough. it is also expensive.  i have a very, very hard time with food, to put it lightly. i'm concerned that the restrictive nature of this food plan will ignite old eating concerns faced in the past. i'm concerned about trying this and it backfiring and me gaining a lot more weight due to the restrictive nature of this food plan, diet, whatever. it seems impossible.  suggestions?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^1^0
glutathione iv used to help me enormously!! i used to do 1 gram per iv vs 2 grams, as the 2 grams made me too out of it, probably from detoxing so much. i used to do it iv up to 6 days per week it is a godsend to me symptomatically.  before i had a central line, i nebulized it, which also worked very well, albeit at a much lower dose, i think 300-600 mg, once or twice a day, can't remember the dosage for sure. [i checked my records: it was only 100 mg per dose, but still worked well!]  i've also tried it sublingually with a powdered glutathione from now foods. that also works, but it's very rough on the inside of my mouth. liposomal did not much for me, and also hard on my mouth.  since insurance no longer covers compounded meds, unless i fight like crazy, and even then, usually not, i'm trying to figure out the best and most economical method, given non-coverage.  no, it does't get rid of infections, but it helps enormously symptomatically.  any comments, experiences, suggestions? thank you!

okay, so out of most of my family, my mom and i don't hunt. everyone else does, and they are always at my dad's ranch where there are apparently tons of ticks.  people keep saying to me that it makes no sense that no one else in my family has lyme and they've been bitten multiple times and are up at the ranch all the time skinning deer and such, but i do.  how do i explain this? it's a valid question. i know a tick has to be infected, but i go around citing research such as 45 percent of ticks are infected in our state trying to justify my lyme.  it is a valid point in some senses. i honestly don't know how to explain this. i know lyme can lay latent for years, but can some people be positive for lyme but never develop symptoms? any suggestions?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
so i had my home and office tested for mold using the mycometrix testing suggested by my llmd.  my office came back with an ermi score of 13 and a hertsmi-2 score of 36. dr. shoemaker recommends an ermi of less than 2 and hertsmi-2 of less than 10 for people with confirmed mold illness. note i do not have confirmed mold illness.  problem is, i'm not sure if this is a current problem in the office, or just evidence of a past problem.  we did get flooded in late 2015 by our neighbor (sewer line backed up) and had a bunch of remediation work performed in dec/jan. (carpets and sheetrock replaced in effected areas.) when the walls were opened up, there was evidence the leaking had been going on for quite some time. all is supposedly now cleaned up and changes have been made to prevent in the future.  the ermi test is done by taking samples of dust around the suspected rooms/areas. it could be the dust i sampled was very old as it was from the top of light fixtures, etc, that don't get cleaned routinely and likely haven't been cleaned since the remediation work.  or..it could be we still have a problem.  my home tested better, but not great. ermi of 3.8 and hertsmi-2 of 16.  i should also state that i don't believe most of my symptoms are mold related. they could be, but many are old old lyme and co symptoms. the only thing that maybe is mold related are my sinus congestion and post nasal drip.  so...not sure what this means. i did relapse right around the time this flood happened at work. so it could be connected. not sure it is the root of my problems, but i'm sure it certainly doesn't help!  thoughts/suggestions?  i'm going to see if we can get additional testing and fully cleaned / decontaminated to try to determine if it is an old or ongoing problem.  -------------------- bite date ? 2/10 symptoms began 5/10 dx'd, after 3 months numerous test and doctors  igm igenex +/cdc + + 23/25, 30, 31, 34, 41, 83/93  currently on:  currently at around 80% +/- most days.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
so judie what do i do because i already have peripheral neuropathy in my legs.. any suggestions on how to protect against it or prevent? i really want to use tindamax but i'm very concerned about that. what about lower dosage?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
after six years on antibiotics, i am done with treatment. now my stomach is messed up. i go between being bloated and gassy to constipation to diarrhea to normal. everyday is different. i've been off antibiotics for about six months now. any suggestions, beside probiotics, to ease the gut issues?^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
hello all,  i have had lots of issues with hydration and staying hydrated throughout my herx reactions. it has caused me what i think many unnecessary er trips and high heart rates. i was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on rehydration supplements that can be added to water.  i am currently getting iv saline 2 times per week to help with this, but want to add to my protocol instead of just drinking a gallon of water a day.  thanks!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i have dental infections that are very painful and cannot take abx.  i tried colloidal silver a while ago and it helped some but did not cure it.  any suggestions on a natural abx is appreciated.  if a get a generic garlic what is the best kind? i would like to have deodorized if it works well.  thanks!  -------------------- 'come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and i will give you rest.' matthew 11:28^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"my most upsetting symptom these days ( and this has gone on a while) is shaking, and weakness.  of course this is not weakness the neurologist will acknowledge, it's more things like fine trembling, muscle flickering when i sit up for a long time, arms kind of shaky when i hold them over my head, and trembling feelings in my legs when i hold them in certain positions.  i got an emg which showed my leg nerves were ""irritated"" but the neuro said there was no sign of demyelination ( like how can they tell anyway? )  i really believe that my confused immune system is trying to kill these little bastards and targeting myelin instead because that's what it really feels like -- unstable nerves. like sometimes just using my muscles for a brief period will stir up a kind of irritation, twitchy, shaky feeling.  i know that knocking down the infection will stop the autoimmune process but in the meantime it freaks me out and makes me afraid to move.  i've tried stuff like xanax and klonopin and this makes me less *concerned* about these sensations but it doesn't change them at all.  so the other day i read that lithium orotate might be helpful with this problem since it helps with ms. i bought some but i'm not sure if i should try it, especially with the mino. i'm actually dying to try it if it helps.  anyone have any experiences with nerve sensations and muscle shakiness and lithium orotate?  i'm also taking ashwagandha for nerve support.  any other suggestions?"^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"i go through bouts of normal bowel movements for days, diarrhea every now and then, and then constipation.  i've always had a skinny waist/gut until a few months ago-- around the time i started aggressive treatment. now my stomach is huge- it looks very distended and like i'm pregnant at times. i need to emphasize i've always had a small waist/ gut until recently.  i showed my friend my belly the other day, and his face was priceless. he said, "" that's not normal and it looks really bad"" ( not in a mean way-- in a what in the world is going on/that's concerning way)  it feels like the top of my gut is never empty and backed up. even when i take magnesium citrate or laxatives, it still feels like this.  i have a colonoscopy and endoscopy coming up, but i live in a state where ""lyme doesn't exist."" i informed the gastroenterologist that i have lyme, and he didn't openly balk at me.  questions:  any ideas as to what is going on?  also, any suggestions as to what to ask the gastroenterologist to test for and look for?  is a colonics a good idea to try every now and then it would it negate the antibiotics and supplements?  *diagnosed with lyme, babesiosis, and bartonella.  thanks so much."^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
tf. thank you so much. i just want her to feel better. we will see dr d in a couple of weeks. the next closest dr in oh  i won't quit till be are bankrupt or she is better. i hear that gluten free is important so i made 8 gf freezer meals today. i just have to be aggressive and think for her.  open to any suggestions. she needs easy nutritional things to eat during the day when she is home alone. my son comes home and fixes dinner but she needs easy stuff during the day.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^1^0
i'm moving out of a place that has a leaky roof & mold issues. what should i bring? i have a foam mattress & bedding, clothes, etc. what about hepa air filters & my vacuum cleaner?  i'm moving to a place that is hot & sunny. do you think that would kill any mold spores in the foam mattress & other stuff? how about unpainted wood?  i could just leave it but the mattress was about $200 plus bedding. my vacuum & air filters would probably be another $400-500 or so. i just bought the vacuum a few months ago.  i know you guys have alot of experience with this. thanks in advance for your suggestions!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i need to find a supplier of bicillin la, as my usual supplier can't source it at the moment. we now live abroad and do not have access to an llmd (was previously under the care of a very good llmd). i've searched high and low on the net, but no luck. do you have any suggestions?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i have very severe neurological lyme [i'm trying my best to type here].  i also have a medical condition that i think is separate from lyme, i couldn't take antibiotics for the neuro-lyme since it would make it worse.  i have made no progress on that medical condition because of the disease impairing my cognition to point that i couldn't communicate correctly with whomever was supposed to treat me. i also won't be seeing a lyme doctor anytime soon.  any suggestions on what herbal/natural/alternate remedies that can help with neurological lyme symptoms [severe]? it's very important for me that my cognition improves as soon as possible.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0

i started doxycycline 5 months after the tick bite (blood test is negative but with mild symptoms). first 300mg/d, and the 400mg/d. now it is the sixth weeks and the symptoms improved in a certain degree. shall i continue with doxy for longer time? can i reduce it to 300mg/d? should i take other things to treat cyst forms (like gse)? i am really confused. can anybody help me and give some suggestions?^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
i'm doing pretty well off abx. i take some herbs and supplements. i feel like i am anywhere from 75-90%.  over 5 months ago i was removing a shrub with large pruners. it probably took me an hour and a lot of muscle. unfortunately, my elbow has not been the same since.  i have had elbow pain which is probably some kind of inflammation or maybe nerve involvement. if i see a physician i am pretty certain they would recommend a course of steroids.  what would you do at this point? i hate to kick the hornet's nest but would a short course stir up things? any other suggestions?  i live in the south and enjoy yard work almost year round. when i tried pruning recently, it only aggravated the elbow more.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0
"as i was posting last week in the medical thread about my neuropathy driving me insane, i thought, you know, for all the things that are still vexing me, there are a lot of sx i either don't have anymore or sx that have gotten so much better i barely notice them.  then i saw the thread, ""how come there are only 45 success stories,"" which had the potential to depress so many people. personally, i *understand* a thread like that, but i can't allow myself to think negatively or nothing positive will come to me (or at least, that's what i believe). of course, i still slip into that negative mindset sometimes - everyone does, and it's easy to do when you're suffering!  so i'm starting this thread, and i hope it's someday pinned up at the top like the success story thread, since there are hundreds of us in progress but not cured yet.  it might give hope and help encourage positive thinking, which my doc and i agree is half the battle (the mind-body connection is huge, especially with chronic illness and chronic pain). of course as i type this, i'm knocking on my wooden desk.  i am a success story in progress!!  my improved or eliminated symptoms are:  overall pain is much less insomnia is gone i have several good hours each day now i can grocery shop for a week's food! i never have a day when i can't walk now my cane is leaning in a corner, dust-covered! walking at the mall/flea market/wal-mart isn't torture on my legs anymore my fingers aren't locking up anymore (i can type!) most days i can think clearly most days i can see clearly i can lift my 5 year old son now i can play with my son on the floor and not worry that i won't be able to get up i can travel without as much pain i can drive without fear that my mind or body will give out on me i'm swelling less in fingers, ankles and face my bell's palsy is less frequent and goes away more quickly  i have been given my life back, albeit in a limited capacity. i'm thankful for each and every tiny bit of healing. i have a long way to go to optimal health, but i can function now, can drive now, can play with my son and *enjoy* life now. pain is not overwhelming my life anymore.  now, if that's not the makings of a success story, i don't know what is! i'm getting there, slowly but surely, and i know there are many, many others out there just like me - on their way to putting lyme in the past!  you guys are a huge part of my road to recovery, even though i mostly lurk. i've learned so much that has helped me, and i hope this post helps someone who is looking for hope or who is facing the daunting idea of years of treatment for lyme. you *can* get better, you *can* improve, you *can* do this!!  gentle hugs- sarah"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
i'm a success story in progress, and i've posted a thread to that effect - because lyme sometimes takes years to cure, i think sometimes the best those of us here (going through tx) can do is look at the smaller successes and not diagnose ourselves as cured/not cured.  i'm cured of several symptoms, for example, but not of every lyme symptom.  as for not being up the mtns - hee hee! my state is not considered endemic (or even barely on the cdc register for lyme), but everywhere i go people tell me they either had it or know someone who has it. so far i've tallied 34 people who live within 30 miles of me who have told me they have it or a family member who lives here has it. plus, a doc in my city was nudged out of treating lyme by insurance companies. i live in a tiny town and he was a family doc, but they got to him.  if it's *that* big of a deal, why on earth are we considered to have only 15 ld cases in the region? it's insane and it's always been insane. do they just not want people to panic about an epidemic? ugh!  here's to many, many more success stories in the future!^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
on march 19,2007 my life virtually ended.i was a endurance athlete,enjoying life,no money or family health issues.  then the sympthoms stated,weakness,fatigue,drop foot,twitching.  doctor to doctor,testing,more tests.finally the crushing diagnosis,,,,als.  i refused to accept this.being an athlete ,i would conquer this hill as well.  knowing i was bitten in 2005,i explored and took the time to learn about lyme.discussed it with the doctors.you all know how that was received.  finally a llmd told me what i longed to hear.some of my sympthoms didn't add up to als.  a window of hope,a diversion from the dismill future ,for sure as my condition progressed,kept telling myself.it's got to get worse before it gets better.  knowing iv treatment was my last window to open,and that it could immflame my condition worse,i knew i had to try,or i'd be always wondering,what if,,,,,,,,,,,.  well,it did make me worse,barely moving with a walker,hands and arms getting worse,etc.  now no more windows to open,it's very depressing,i know when i pull the picc line,it will be like pulling my last hope,and all those smuge neurologist will have been right.  all i ever wanted was to one day walk in their office again and say,,see.you didn't even give me a benefit of the doubt.  so my depression deepens everyday,knowing tommorrow will be worse then today.  i am a catholic,i pray hard daily,but i guess he is busy,,,maybe you all could find him for me and say a prayer for me,,thanks  ....i seperated your post so i could read it. i have trouble taking in things so was not able to read what the others wrote.  ...there is hope. i was bedridden for many years and am now able to get out daily. i use a power chair and am able to walk at times.  ..i do not think there is just one treatment plan such as iv. i too thought the iv would make me well.  ...i have not had overnight success yet. but, i am slowly improving. it has taken many different things.  ...i could not use a walker as my arms were too weak. i drank from a star as i could not sit up and drink or eat.  now, i prepare my own meals again as long as i keep them simple.  the rabbit in me is gone. i am a turtle now but at least i am moving and staying in the race.  i tried antidepressants and they took the wind out of my sails.  i did better off of them. but, i know it helps others.^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
our child is almost all better, but only tested positive for lyme. we suspect that he was initially infected about a year before he was diagnosed, due to a progression of health issues.  if the bite occured a year prior to his dx, his first symptom was encopresis, (he had no sensation of impending bm's, which ultimately lasted for 2 years), then about a month later, a 9 day bout with severe diarhea.  a case of strep throat, then the falling asleep at the lunch table in preschool... also, his behavior became increasingly difficult.  finally, last summer, he ran a high fever (105) for 9 days, then developed a pink rash on his chest, more rashes formed, and within a couple days the rashes had the central clearing of a typical bullseye rash. in all, he had over 20 of these rashes, on his chest, stomach, arms, legs, back, genitals and face.  he tested cdc positive for lyme, was very sick for several months. too tired to walk, joint pain in his knees and ankles, headaches, night sweats, stomach pain (which started before abx), ocd-like symptoms, impulsive/aggressive behaviors, he'd make threatening comments, and temporal lobe absence seizures.  his current sxs are night sweats (roughly 50% of the time) and the seizures, which according to his last eeg, are getting weaker/further apart.  all of the other symptoms are gone. (thank god!!) through the course of his tx, he tested positive (cdc positive) 3 times, with the most recent positive test in june of this year.  so yes, you can get your child back!! for more positive stories, there is a 'success stories' sticky. i haven't posted there yet, as we aren't quite 100%, but will when we finally get there.  take care, hoping for the best for you and your children. kp  ps: regarding mepron... some have no problem with it, some have a tough time. we got lucky, no problem with it. as per our child, it tastes very yucky. we use one of the oral syringes, to shoot it in real quick, then he follows it immediately with a shot of nesquick, chocolate milk.

i can't see any of this small print there, so i'm copying it over here to read... betty   lyme disease success story  my name is perry louis fields. i'm a us track and field athlete and i compete in the 800m and 1600m (arguably the two hardest events in track and field.)   in 2003 i was just out of college training for the 2004 olympics. it was a few months before i was going to bolivia to train at altitude.   i was bitten by a deer tick at an outdoor festival called the highland games in north carolina. two days later i pulled the tick off the back of my head at the base of my neck.   growing up in the country, i didn't think it was such a big deal. after all i've been bitten by everything.   for a few weeks i had flu like symptoms and did not know about tick infections. i thought i had very bad pms and a cold from running so hard.   after a few weeks it went away and i went to bolivia.   i continued to train and run well for 2 years until the 2005 us track and field championships, where i was expected to win.   for a few weeks prior to the event i had considerable stress from a coaching change and moving from tucson, az to orlando fl all within a few days. training was sporadic and i had days where i would throw up but it wasn't anything i was eating. i felt slightly toxic.   on the day of the big race, nothing was abnormal. during my race, however, it was a different story. i was racing the 800m (a two lap all out sprint race).   coming through the first lap i was in the perfect position to make my move but noticed my arms and legs becoming cold and numb. i had never experienced anything like it before. it was a nightmare with all eyes on me.   i finished the race dead last and then went to throw up soon after (but again it was nothing i was eating).   my track season was trashed and i had no way of explaining what had happened.  i went home to see my parents for the first time in a while. while at home my mother noticed me scratching the back of my neck. she took a look and told me of the bull's eye rash on the back of my neck.   i immediately knew what it was from and started researching everything i could about lyme disease.   i figured i could knock it out with a course of antibiotics. i decided to see the best infectious disease doctor who specialized in lyme disease in the southeast, dr. j from charlotte, north carolina.   sitting in a room full of aids patients and lyme disease patients i realized the severity of the situation.   dr. j ordered a series of costly tests as well as 4 types of high powered antibiotics, after i told him the story. * later on i found out from another test that i could not detox sulfa drugs (antibiotics.)   once the tests were received... i was positive for lyme (i had the worst bands possible on my western blot test) and i had a co-infection.   the antibiotics did kill off some of the lyme. my health deteriorated quickly while on antibiotics.  i was as feeble as a 100 year old lady. for weeks i would stay in the bed. i couldn't feed myself and i certainly couldn't drive anywhere. i felt like toxic mush.   every square inch of my body was in pain and while this went on for months, i couldn't see the outcome being very positive.  his office called me one day saying that i could go back to running if i wanted and then later do another course of treatment.   this made me realize that while they were treating people they really had no idea how bad their patients were feeling. i couldn't run if i was being chased by the mob! how on earth would i go back to even jogging or walking in my condition? how on earth would i ever be normal again?   after declining further conventional treatment, for it took almost 8 months to get over what one course of antibiotics did, i later found out that one thing that was prescribed, which lyme doctors do, is actually banned in the uk for killing people.   thus i had to go with my gut on this and become my own expert at solving this puzzle. i later contacted another lyme specialist and didn't care for what he had to say either.   one medical doctor i had to go see during an emergency visit one saturday morning told me he didn't think people could get lyme in south carolina? *  later i realized that my visit was due to a neurological manifestation of meningitis. i literally woke up and thought i snapped my neck. my neck became so stiff after a load pop and i couldn't move my neck so i had to see a doctor immediately.   as months went by i had severe depression, or so i thought. to this day i don't know if i had depression or if the lyme bacteria was in my brain causing mental health issues (see lyme symptoms as this is a real phenomena.)   everyday i thought about how i could end my life because i didn't really have a life anymore. i was a strong athlete reduced to this vegetable.   a few times i was close to telling my mother to commit me as i didn't think i could control myself any longer. i thought i was going to hurt myself or someone else.   even during these dark times there was this spark, deep down inside still glowing. i don't know how, but it was. this tiny little spark was still there telling me that i would get through this.   mentally i told myself to get over running completely. i just couldn't deal with the misery of not being able to compete as an athlete again. it just hurt my chances of healing.  so mentally i had to tell myself, on the surface, to move on and work on just getting back to a normal life. the goal was to live normally (but believe me deep down inside that little spark was still there and what would ultimately be the reason for my full recovery, finding all my answers to this lyme riddle, and getting me back to training and competing.)   after i semi-recovered from the conventional route, i decided to go unconventional. i've long been a proponent of alternative health.   after all i found out i was gluten intolerant and that i had a few food allergies from an applied kinesiologist (a type of alternative doctor.)   no conventional doctor, i ever saw as a child said ``it might be something you're eating'' when i went for so many visits about earaches, stomach aches, etc. as soon as i stopped eating certain foods i never had to go to the doctor again.  during these past 4 years i went on this enormous search to get the ``cure.''  i did everything humanly possible (even to the point of experimentation on myself.)  i would not take ``no, we can't help you'' for an answer. i simply continued my quest.  the result is my doing something that was deemed close to impossible. i'm not only healthy...i'm healthier than i was before i was bitten. (no kidding!)  my training and racing proves that. i'm the fastest and strongest i've ever been; which is truly amazing! i still to this day have not found anyone with the success i've had.  lance armstrong did for cancer, what i hope to do for lyme disease. ******************************************   i have sometimes told myself that i wish i had cancer rather then lyme. someone with terminal cancer may feel otherwise, but i'm truly upset that the research on this disease is so inconclusive. the treatment for it is inconclusive.   it's like nobody has had any experience with it at all, yet hundreds of thousands of people get it every year (i think that number is more like millions.)   there is no cure. there is no one good way to treat it.  so instead of saying ``why me''...which i have to admit i did a few times, after this health quest of mine, i realized the answer to that question.   i'm here to simply share my story, to give hope and help people answer their own health riddles. there are multiple ways to treat it and multiple steps you can take to treat it.   so there is hope with a disease that seems completely hopeless.  see more pictures of perry's lyme story here.   perry at the 2004 olympic trails, one year after her lyme tick bite.  photo credit: prettysporty.com perry at the 2005 us track and field championships, right before her lyme disease took over.  photo credit: prettysporty.com perry receiving high c iv to boost her immune system in 2006. perry feeling better and attending ferrari club's wounded warrior charity event. perry having successfully defeated her lyme disease has gone back to athletics again. lymelife movie premiere   track the progress of perry's beat lyme book- updated weekly!   lyme disease bookmark  more lyme disease resources here^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
hello all,  back in sept of 08(not too long ago) i tested cdc pos. with two bands on igm. i was devastated, but happy that i at least tested pos.  i spent the next 2 months fighting to stay on antibiotics until i could get to an llmd (thanks to all of you at lymenet!)which i managed to do luckily.  prior to seeing the llmd i was on 200mg doxy for about 12 weeks. a low dose, but it was something.  since my first appt with my llmd in november 08 i have made great progress. i have been treating bart with 600mg rifampin a day along with the usual supplements and trying my best to follow the lyme diet.  i am happy to say that after 9 months of what seemed like pure hell in the begining i am now tapering off the rifampin to 300 mg a day for a month and then if all is well with no flare ups i will stop.  i am taking cats claw now and she said i will most likely have to take that for about a year for maintenance (any info on that is greatly appreciated!)along with the supplements ,but i am ok with that.  i want to thank you all for all the info and support. before i had lyme and co i knew they were bad, but not this bad.  my story in a short one compared to most of you here and you are all always in my thoughts and prayers.  so although i am feeling better, i know i will never be done with this disease, but i will not live the rest of my life in fear of relapse. if it happens, i at least know what to look for and where to get treatment.  just wanted to share my success.  thank you again to all who led me to my llmd, answered my many questions, and just plain supported me throughout this. i hope i can continue to do the same for others.^0^1^1^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"there is the progress of the antibiotics killing off the bacteria. with that you get the nasty sick herx reactions and some feeling better.  there is the progress of your body structures healing themselves because they aren't being eaten up by lyme/toxins anymore. this is a slow process, especially with nerve damage.  i've been on oral's for 10 months now. i'm still sick. i get times of feeling good. however, when i feel bad, i'm not as hellishly miserable as i was earlier in the year.  i have had wonderful success in treating the cognitive symptoms....forgetfullness...well basically swiss cheese memory....... i started taking naamenda it is an alzheimer's drug. they have handed out one month sample packs to several of my doctors. it is worth it to try it out.  i noticed an improvement in two doses. after a couple of weeks.....i was in awe i kid you not, this drug has given me my brain back.... mostly, most of the time. sure, there are times where i just don't function. but my overall level of cognitive functioning has improved 99% if after the one month free trial pack, you don't have improvement....no harm done not usually bad side effects  so, lyme is a long road recovering from it is unlike any other illness  i am on my second round with this disease... note my membership number """"210 i started back in the dark ages.....  do whatever you need to, to get better. antibiotics supplements psychiatric meds using meds off label use (like namenda) counseling friends online support group (i had to start one) spiritual support exercise anything......  -------------------- lyme is like the flu. you can get it and recover, but you can always get it again. i had progressive peripheral neuropathy for 2.75 years. my primary doc dx me with lyme & i started antibiotics, 12-31-08. my neuropathy has stopped getting worse!"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"i got sick over a year ago. i found the tick and suspected lyme right away. i only delayed going to the doctor or realizing that i had lyme because my previous information about lyme was wrong.  i mistakenly thought you couldn't get it without a bullseye rash (which i didn't have), that the tiny deer tick nymph i pulled off of me was not engorged (hadn't seen one that small before), and that a couple of months of antibiotics would easily get rid of lyme if i did have it. i also thought that doctors knew all about it.  two months after my tick bite, i went to my doctor and asked her if i could have lyme, and she laughed at me and said of course i don't. (lyme is extremely rare in my state, don't ya know.)  then i started reading a lot about it and became convinced that i did have lyme. two more doctor visits later, and my doctor stopped laughing and i had antibiotics for 3 months (after i showed her some persuasive research to convince her to extend her prescription that long).  she still doubted i had lyme, and tried to convince me not to go to the llmd because it sounded ""shady"" to her. she did this with my best interests at heart, but she was wrong.  my symptoms were mild enough from the beginning that for the first two months, i explained them all away and thought they were unrelated, so i didn't even know for sure that i was sick until 2 months went by.  when i realized that it was lyme, then i thought that i must have a mild case because my symptoms are not as bad as many people's i have read about on here. i thought mild symptoms meant it would be easy to eradicate.  i also thought that it would be easy to get better because i started treatment within 10 weeks instead of years.  i didn't know that ""early"" treatment that has a high chance of rapid success meant within days of the tick bite, not weeks or months.  the biggest reason i was convinced i would be better within a couple of months is because i could not understand how all the doctors could be so mistaken as to think that a few weeks of antibiotics cured lyme, unless people usually seemed to get better in that time and then relapsed later.  i took my first round of antibiotics for 3 months and only saw some improvement the third month. i was never without symptoms. then i relapsed immediately 2 days after i stopped taking the drug. of course i was crushed with frustration and disappointment.  after that i went through several months of terror, fearing that my symptoms would get much worse than they had been and that it would take a long time for me to get well. but i still thought, in the back of my mind, that all this was temporary and would be over soon.  i hesitated to make any major changes in my life because i thought this could all be over in another month or two, and then it would be silly.  it took many months for me to realize that it might take me two or more years to get better, and that in some ways i will have to change my life permanently even when my symptoms are gone.  now that i have been seeing my llmd for almost 8 months, i know i am on the right track because i have seen some improvement in the last few months, but here i am more than a year later, still sick. there is progress, but it's slow.  i am less afraid of the chance of worse symptoms because it's been a long time and i haven't gotten them yet. but the symptoms i do have move around and change all the time.  i finally realized that i would be a lot happier to quit feeling angry and frustrated every month or two because i still wasn't better yet, and to quit fearing every change in symptoms as a sign of worsening or unknown coinfections.  i am doing everything i can to get better, and i will get better in the end. now i try to hang onto that faith and not to worry about how long it will take, or what symptoms might come and go before i get there, or what crazy things i have to do in the pursuit of healing.  the accounts i have read suggest that all or almost all lyme symptoms are completely reversible when the treatment is successful. so for instance, if you have joint pain in a joint, it doesn't mean you will always have arthritis there.  i have had to make changes in my diet, schedule, finances, etc. to accommodate my need to take care of myself, since my life is not going to go right back to the way it was before. i have had to ask for help, and give up a lot of activities.  i felt tremendous relief once i accepted that i would be dealing with this for the foreseeable future, and made plans to do so.  i think that the doubt and fear are normal stages, and you can get through them so you're not stuck there all the time.  acceptance--that life isn't fair and we're stuck fighting this battle that we don't deserve and have to make the best of--seems to be one key to getting out of the mental swamp of doubt and fear.  knowledge is another key. the more you learn about this disease, the more you will understand and notice things in your body and experience that reassure you that you are on the right track toward getting better.  you need to learn enough that you can feel certain in yourself even when the people around you, who you normally trust, are telling you that you're wrong and making you doubt yourself. also hold onto logic and recognize when doctors and others are telling you something that doesn't make logical sense.  good luck, and i'm sorry that you have had to join our company here.  -------------------- don't forget to laugh! and when you're going through hell, keep going!  bitten 5/25/2009 in perry county, indiana. diagnosed by llmd 12/2/2009."^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
hello, all!  i have felt like my normal self for months now, but i am left with 1 symptom that is apparently permanent.....it is so minor now though that i only notice it when it is quiet. my head still has a humming noise and occasionally my ears ring. but as long as i keep busy or am around any noise at all, it is not an issue.  that, coupled with the fact that my ll pa told me in march that my labs results show active acute infection for lyme, have kept me from posting this success story.  but i cannot imagine this not being considered success when i am back to normal functioning and have been since february.  so i am ready to say, either i am done with this stupid disease, or i have an awesome immune system that is kicking lyme's a.. right now!  my story.....i had multiple ticks attached over the course of a year and a half, but did not become ill until last may. i had one tick roll off me days before i became ill, that was fully engorged. that was the first time that had happened....not sure if that is why i finally got sick, or if it was just that i finally came in contact with a sick one (hence my screen name!)  started with a fever that climbed to over 103 degrees. i am fortunate that the er doc took me seriously when i expressed concern over my tick exposure. since the ticks were from arkansas (i am in indiana, but have property in the ozarks), she was thinking ehrlichiosis. but she tested for many diseases, including lyme disease. treatment was initiated with doxycycline for 2 weeks initially.  my initial titers came back negative for all but rocky mountain spotted fever, and this was already showing low positive for recent infection. while waiting for my second set of titers 3 weeks later, i became very ill with meningitis, white blood cells down to 1.7 at one point, liver damage and more. still, no one believed i had rmsf as i was not sick enough they said! hah!  second set of titers....positive for rmsf and lyme disease! shocked us all! we weren't even looking at lyme, as (here comes something many of you have heard...wait for it......) there are no ticks in arkansas that carry lyme spirochetes!!!! hahahaha!  western blot confirmed the lyme, so i was cdc positive. fortunately, that made folks take me seriously. at least for awhile....  got a second 2 week course of doxy. however (shocking again, isn't it?) the disease progressed to a neurological issue for me....imagine!  iv rocephin times 1 month. as soon as it was done, symptoms returned. that is when i was dumped by my up-until-now supportive id. found out for the mext several months that i was basically on my own. my id had said that the symptoms i had left were due to damage done to my never cells, or possibly an auto-immune response. since i had no md near by that could help, i had no choice but to hope he was right...no more antibiotics for me!  i continued to get better on my own, taking very good care of myself and eating well, taking a few supplements. but i was still left with this lingering symptom...so i made a very long trip to a lyme literate practitioner so that i could have an mri and some further bloodwork...chose the one i did because their practice does support the non antibiotic treatment if a person is at that point...they use supplements, diet, etc. along with antibiotics of course, to treat. it was all good news, except for the persistent antibodies. my ll pa said either i was still carrying around infection but that my body/immune system was going to town on it, or i may be one of those people who will always test positive but not actually still have active little buggers in there.  since that visit in march, i had a bout with diverticulitis....was on cipro and flagyl. also had doxy again for something unrelated to lyme. no herx, nothing! so i think i am in the clear! but of course, i will never rest totally easy on that, and feel that i have to keep healthy the rest of my life, or this could rear its ugly head again.  so here i am a year later...and healthy! i felt it was time to share this, as i know there are folks new to this board who desperately need to hear that folks can get better. i know, because i was one of them.  follow your gut on this....sometimes only you know when it is time to take a break from treatment-the treatment can make you sicker sometimes.....but keep in mind that i was treated early, and so long term treatment was not necessary.  there are lots of good people on this board, and lots of good information as well. don't know how i would have gotten through this without all of you.  i don't visit often anymore, but will check in when i do. please know that there is an end to this for most.....it is so hard to remember that on the bad days, i know.  take care of yourselves....don't give in to this!!!!^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"hello,  i am copying and pasting this from another thread i recently posted on. it fit into that thread and also ""success stories."" congratulations to everyone who is able to post on this success threat, and let's keep working so more and more people get the opportunity.  i am a patient from ca who went to india for embryonic stem cells. i never post on these boards but i had heard about this thread and thought i'd share my story.  i am doing amazingly well. i've had chronic lyme (babesia and bartonella) for 7+ years and my complications included neuropathy, arthritis, tremors and twitches, brain lesions, cardiac problems, chronic nausea, etc.  post stem cells, all of my pain is gone, i am off all narcotic pain killers, all tremor medication, all heart medication, my brain lesions improved greatly (as measured by spect scans), my food allergies are gone, and the list goes on. i'm finally able to be off of antibiotics for the first time since my diagnosis.  i believe this is possible because of my previously aggressive antibiotic treatment and the new improvement of my immune system with the stem cells.  before deciding to go to india, i failed all treatments that i tried (including almost 100 hyperbaric oxygen sessions). i feel that antibiotics did a good job to lessen the bacterial load, but my body was so deteriorated from the disease, something needed to repair it from that perspective. embryonic stem cells did that for me. it is like i am a new person now.  since i was the first patient to go through this, we don't know what the future will hold. but, so far, i've had a six month stretch of health and that's six months more than i ever thought i'd have again in my lifetime before i went to india.  the doctor's technology is unique as she is using one donated embryo to treat and endless number of patients. she is the only one that i'm aware of in the world using embryonic stem cells in human application (she just filed a patent). her stem cells are 100% pure (meaning no chemical, animal feeder cells, etc.).  i can't say the treatment is right for everyone but it is thus far, the biggest blessing of my life. i hope this information has helped those who are interested understand it a little better.  it is not a cure for lyme (stem cells won't kill bacteria) but i believe it will strengthen the immune system to better cope. my personal opinion is that much of a lyme patient's pain, fatigue, etc. after they have had proper treatment, is not necessarily due to active bacteria but the devastation of what has happened in their bodies over the years (degeneration of nerves, muscle, etc.).  i'm always available for questions if anyone would like to know more. i'm going back to india in july for 3 weeks for a booster series (i was there for two months the first trip). i blog at www.healthcarehacks.com and update often for anyone who would like to follow.  many blessings, a  -------------------- amy b. scher blog: www.healthcarehacks.com"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^1^0^0^0
- desperationin,  i hope you don't mind that i've added some more white space to your post. i've been wanting to read your post for some time now but could not until i broke up the text some more.  so, i also added this to the success thread where i see you just posted this, too, just after your post over there.  for those with eyes that dart and swirl - or a short attention span - i hope this format helps.  what a wonderful letter to offer us all hope.  =================================================  my lyme disease success story  posted by desperationin  23 november, 2011   i wanted to post my lyme disease success story. when i was incredibly sick a few years ago, i recall how much i sought out these stories and wished there were more of them.  often, it was said on this board that people who get better do not return to post their success stories because they go back to living normal lives.  i just wanted to return and post mine here to let you know that i am living a normal life and that there is hope and life after lyme. when i was very sick, i never in a million years believed that i would be here telling a success story of recovery.  i wanted to post my story for thanksgiving because i sure have a lot to be thankful for.  in january 2007, i was a second year law student at a school in nashville, tn.  in january or february i began to feel my health tanking with a combination of strange symptoms.  i felt weak, the side of my head and later my body felt like they were in a constant vibration, i began losing a lot of weight (being too thin naturally)- the symptoms were getting progressively worse. i was very tired and had trouble thinking.  i felt something very serious was wrong with my health. i had no idea what a tick even was and had no risk factors for lyme. i also suspect i was bitten on the back of my head since symptoms started there, but i did not remember a bite and needless to say nobody saw a suspicious rash.  then, i went through the typical lyme diagnosis story. i went to over 15 doctors including those in infectious disease, hematology, oncology, and even a psychiatrist. like many others, i was ridiculed, called a hypochondriac, sent to psychiatrists.  one doctor did test me for lyme but an elisa came back negative- but the fact that he ordered this test got me looking into lyme disease on my own. i scoured the internet for an illness that would fit my strange bouquet of symptoms, considering everything from cancer to exotic parasites.  i spent the summer in chicago, trying to survive through working at my legal internship. i finished the term of my first internship but had to quit my second summer internship early due to the progressing mysterious illness.  by the end of the summer, i was beginning to feel some strange joint pains and everything else was getting worse. at the end of that terrible summer, my now husband proposed to me- i was very fortunate that he stayed with me despite the fact that i was getting sicker and sicker without anyone knowing why.   eventually, i read about the lyme controversy and testing issues and convinced a doctor to agree to send blood to igenex for lyme and coinfection testing.  when i saw the result, i finally realized i had lyme- not only lyme, but also all the coinfections including both forms of erlichia, babesia, rocky mountain spotted fever, and others i can't now recall (later energetic testing also found bartonella but this was not confirmed by the blood tests).  all in all, i went undiagnosed for over six months. i take sole credit for diagnosing myself based on my internet research and the help of folks on this website who shed light on the huge political and medical controversy surrounding this disease.  i was happy we knew what the illness was, but by then my life was literally falling apart. i did not go back to nashville for the school year and transferred to a law school close to home in cleveland, oh, hoping to do a semester near my family where i could have some help.   however, after going to school for three weeks, i realized i was too sick to continue. i took leave from law school for the year because i could not think or look at a book. i was so sick and tired that it was hard to walk around the block or do the basic tasks of daily life.  my whole life, i prided myself on my intellectual ability and academic success and i could not even read anymore. i felt that i lost my entire identity and fell into a deep depression in addition to being just physically ill.   in september, i went to a lyme doctor in pa for treatment and started antibiotics. i got a picc line and spent over five months getting daily infusions of iv rocephin. one line got infected and i had to get a second line.  to our dismay, the rocephin did not really make me all that much better- it actually felt like i was getting worse. i continued doing antibiotic regimens, but they also were not doing wonders and i continued to feel very sick.  however, i believe the antibiotics did stop lyme's progress and enabled me to very slowly get on my feet and begin exercising that spring.  when i was sick, my family tried everything to get me well. it did not help that i am somewhat of a pessimist and did not handle the challenges presented by lyme very well. during that year, when i had to quit school, i was so sick both physically and emotionally that i contemplated suicide.  i felt that i was a burden on my entire family, that i could not recover or work again, and that i really had no future outside of being so sick all the time. only the encouragement of my family, especially my mom's ``never give up attitude'' and care and kept me going in that very dark time.   we tried everything. in addition to antibiotics, we went exploring all kinds of alternative therapies. i went to an alternative doctor to get iv infusions based on energetic testing.  my mom and i learned to muscle test and i took a huge bagful of various supplements each day, which we regulated based on muscle testing. i did all kinds of herbs, acupuncture, homeopathy, and massage for lymph drainage.  at various points we purchased and used dr. k's kmt 1000 machine the beamray rife machine. we saw numerous alternative practitioners in addition to lyme doctors.  ohio is sadly a black hole for this disease as there are no conventional doctors i knew of then (or now) who recognize and treat this disease. there also are not many alternative practitioners we found in ohio who have much experience with lyme.  i suspect that most people suffering from chronic lyme in my state are misdiagnosed and treated for other diseases.  as summer rolled around, i still felt terrible and was not sure if i could ever return to nashville to finish law school. however, my family and my fianc?e encouraged me to return to law school in nashville.   but i was still incredibly ill and could not take care of myself. my mother's employer was very generous and allowed her to work from nashville so that she could stay with me and help me. i returned to nashville, this time living with my mother, and eventually finished my final year of school.  nashville, i found, had better resources for lyme treatment. we found an alternative chiropractor who had some experience with lyme, rife thrapy, and who practiced flower essences.  we also found a wonderful conventional doctor who was in the process of learning about lyme disease treatment and who was even knowledgeable about the patricia kane protocol and to whom we went for iv glutathione infusions.  i heard there were other practitioners who did hyperbaric oxygen therapy for lyme there too, but we never tried that. this was much more medical support than we had in ohio.  my ``lyme'' doctor at that time was in connecticut and we had phone consultations with him. he was a whiz about antibiotics but did not do or know much about any alternative therapies.  that year, i continued rigorous antibiotic treatment, trying different combinations. i took numerous antibiotics and meds during this ordeal, including bicillin injections, and the mepron yellow paint which literally broke the bank since i had no prescription coverage.  in may, i graduated law school and got married. a few months later i took the bar exam. although i could think again enough to finish law school and study for and pass the bar, i still felt very sick.  the antibiotics clearly helped but fell far short of any kind of cure. also, when i tried to take breaks from antibiotics during that second year of treatment, i had to start them again very quickly because i would just slip and get worse.   i lost hope that i would ever reach a point where i would go a day feeling energetic and normal and not having to think about this dreaded disease and i never thought i would be able to stop antibiotics for lyme.  after i took the bar, my mother suggested a radical step of going to germany for treatment with the bionic 880 photon therapy machine. she had read about the experiences of other lyme sufferers on this forum and on the internet and thought that it could help.  in october my mom, dad amd i traveled to germany to do the bionic 880 treatment with dr. w. in germany, dr. w's energetic testing showed lyme at the highest point on his testing machine- the needle of the machine seemed to strain the lyme detecting equipment.   i treated with the bionic 880 and did the iv infusions and ozone therapy he had in his office where they take out a good deal of blood, infuse it with the ozone, and then put it back into you.  i admit, i was pretty skeptical about the treatment, but i was hopeful that it might help. at my last session with dr. w in germany, the lyme showed as non-existent on his testing equipment and he pronounced me lyme free.  but i did not feel so lyme free and when i returned to the states i still felt very sick. after germany, however, i stopped taking all antibiotics (we stopped taking all medications and supplements a few weeks before going to germany as dr. w suggested).   however, after returning, i gradually began to feel better and got that ``spark of life'' back that i thought i would never feel again. i felt more and more like my old self. and this time, i did not appear to get worse after stopping the antibiotics, so it seemed like the photon therapy did ``something.''  from that first visit to germany in the fall of 2009, i stopped and stayed off all antibiotics for lyme.   in january, soon after returning from germany, i learned that i was pregnant. however, about six weeks later i had a miscarriage. after that, i seemed to slide down in terms of lyme symptoms.  i long thought that i would not be able to have a child because of the lyme ordeal. my symptoms then started to return and my family planned another trip to germany for may.  when we returned to dr. w about half a year later, his energetic testing showed that lyme was active, but still nowhere near the level it was on the first visit, when it seemed to be off the charts on his energetic testing machine.  this time, he used the bionic 880 to treat with coinfection nosodes in order to address the erlichia, babesia, etc. again, when we left, his energetic testing showed no lyme or coinfections.   this time, however, my family purchased a bionic 880 machine to use at home if needed. we were fortunate to find one used in the states. when we returned home, i slowly felt my condition improve.  when i felt like i was slipping or my symptoms were returning, i repeated the treatment on my bionic 880 at home, using the lyme nosodes from germany or those we got here from deseret biologicals.  we would repeat the photon treatment when muscle testing and my symptoms indicated.  first it was once a week, then every two weeks, then rarer and rarer. since returning from the first visit to germany in october of 2009 i have not returned to taking any antibiotics.  also, after the first visit to germany, i started a full time legal job, which i handled just fine. nine months later, i switched to a more demanding legal job and worked even longer big firm hours, often staying up until midnight to handle legal work.  i never thought this would ever be possible given how sick i was previously.  after returning from the second trip to germany in the spring of 2010, in the summer, i was diagnosed with thyroid disease. i am not sure if this was caused by the photon therapy, lyme, or both, but i felt that perhaps my thyroid issue was partly to blame for my prior miscarriage.  i was not upset about the thyroid because it seemed like a cakewalk compared to the lyme, from which i seemed to be recovering. the thyroid issue was controlled with a pill a day and occasional monitoring by an endocrinologist.   in the beginning of this year, i again learned that i was pregnant and a few months ago i had a healthy baby girl.   i did not take antibiotics during pregnancy because i was feeling okay and by then i had been off all antibiotics for two years. at birth, i had a cord blood sample sent to igenex for lyme testing and it came back negative.  although i am very worried and plan to monitor her closely, my daughter seems to be doing fine. i am on maternity leave and look forward to going back to my job. i do not think about lyme every day, just once in awhile to remember what my family and i went through and to be thankful for what i have now.  i am not sure if i am cured and i am not sure if i will ever feel just like i did before lyme, but i feel good. my symptoms are gone and i no longer think about lyme and it is no longer a part of my life. of course, i am worried about lyme coming back, but i plan to use the photon machine if i feel any symptoms returning.  during my journey, i met others who have beaten this disease in different ways and using different therapies and who now lead normal lives.  i feel very thankful to have had such great family support during my battle with lyme because they gave me the strength to go on and hoped in my place when i had no hope left inside of me. i know how much of a burden lyme can wreck on your life physically, emotionally, and financially.  when i was very sick and not getting better in spite of very rigorous and costly treatment, i felt that i had nothing left to live for.  all i have to say is that i learned how little qualification i have to work as a fortune teller because i was wrong in confidently predicting that i would be a casualty of this disease when, today, i sit here sharing my success story.  i wish all of you much health and a happy thanksgiving holiday.

i wanted to post my lyme disease success story. when i was incredibly sick a few years ago, i recall how much i sought out these stories and wished there were more of them. often, it was said on this board that people who get better do not return to post their success stories because they go back to living normal lives. i just wanted to return and post mine here to let you know that i am living a normal life and that there is hope and life after lyme. when i was very sick, i never in a million years believed that i would be here telling a success story of recovery. i wanted to post my story for thanksgiving because i sure have a lot to be thankful for.  in january 2007, i was a second year law student at a school in nashville, tn. in january or february i began to feel my health tanking with a combination of strange symptoms. i felt weak, the side of my head and later my body felt like they were in a constant vibration, i began losing a lot of weight (being too thin naturally)- the symptoms were getting progressively worse. i was very tired and had trouble thinking. i felt something very serious was wrong with my health. i had no idea what a tick even was and had no risk factors for lyme. i also suspect i was bitten on the back of my head since symptoms started there, but i did not remember a bite and needless to say nobody saw a suspicious rash.  then, i went through the typical lyme diagnosis story. i went to over 15 doctors including those in infectious disease, hematology, oncology, and even a psychiatrist. like many others, i was ridiculed, called a hypochondriac, sent to psychiatrists. one doctor did test me for lyme but an elisa came back negative- but the fact that he ordered this test got me looking into lyme disease on my own. i scoured the internet for an illness that would fit my strange bouquet of symptoms, considering everything from cancer to exotic parasites.  i spent the summer in chicago, trying to survive through working at my legal internship. i finished the term of my first internship but had to quit my second summer internship early due to the progressing mysterious illness. by the end of the summer, i was beginning to feel some strange joint pains and everything else was getting worse. at the end of that terrible summer, my now husband proposed to me- i was very fortunate that he stayed with me despite the fact that i was getting sicker and sicker without anyone knowing why.  eventually, i read about the lyme controversy and testing issues and convinced a doctor to agree to send blood to igenex for lyme and coinfection testing. when i saw the result, i finally realized i had lyme- not only lyme, but also all the coinfections including both forms of erlichia, babesia, rocky mountain spotted fever, and others i can't now recall (later energetic testing also found bartonella but this was not confirmed by the blood tests). all in all, i went undiagnosed for over six months. i take sole credit for diagnosing myself based on my internet research and the help of folks on this website who shed light on the huge political and medical controversy surrounding this disease.  i was happy we knew what the illness was, but by then my life was literally falling apart. i did not go back to nashville for the school year and transferred to a law school close to home in cleveland, oh, hoping to do a semester near my family where i could have some help. however, after going to school for three weeks, i realized i was too sick to continue. i took leave from law school for the year because i could not think or look at a book. i was so sick and tired that it was hard to walk around the block or do the basic tasks of daily life. my whole life, i prided myself on my intellectual ability and academic success and i could not even read anymore. i felt that i lost my entire identity and fell into a deep depression in addition to being just physically ill.  in september, i went to a lyme doctor in pa for treatment and started antibiotics. i got a picc line and spent over five months getting daily infusions of iv rocephin. one line got infected and i had to get a second line. to our dismay, the rocephin did not really make me all that much better- it actually felt like i was getting worse. i continued doing antibiotic regimens, but they also were not doing wonders and i continued to feel very sick. however, i believe the antibiotics did stop lyme's progress and enabled me to very slowly get on my feet and begin exercising that spring.  when i was sick, my family tried everything to get me well. it did not help that i am somewhat of a pessimist and did not handle the challenges presented by lyme very well. during that year, when i had to quit school, i was so sick both physically and emotionally that i contemplated suicide. i felt that i was a burden on my entire family, that i could not recover or work again, and that i really had no future outside of being so sick all the time. only the encouragement of my family, especially my mom's ``never give up attitude'' and care and kept me going in that very dark time.  we tried everything. in addition to antibiotics, we went exploring all kinds of alternative therapies. i went to an alternative doctor to get iv infusions based on energetic testing. my mom and i learned to muscle test and i took a huge bagful of various supplements each day, which we regulated based on muscle testing. i did all kinds of herbs, acupuncture, homeopathy, and massage for lymph drainage. at various points we purchased and used dr. k's kmt 1000 machine the beamray rife machine. we saw numerous alternative practitioners in addition to lyme doctors. ohio is sadly a black hole for this disease as there are no conventional doctors i knew of then (or now) who recognize and treat this disease. there also are not many alternative practitioners we found in ohio who have much experience with lyme. i suspect that most people suffering from chronic lyme in my state are misdiagnosed and treated for other diseases.  as summer rolled around, i still felt terrible and was not sure if i could ever return to nashville to finish law school. however, my family and my fianc?e encouraged me to return to law school in nashville. but i was still incredibly ill and could not take care of myself. my mother's employer was very generous and allowed her to work from nashville so that she could stay with me and help me. i returned to nashville, this time living with my mother, and eventually finished my final year of school.  nashville, i found, had better resources for lyme treatment. we found an alternative chiropractor who had some experience with lyme, rife thrapy, and who practiced flower essences. we also found a wonderful conventional doctor who was in the process of learning about lyme disease treatment and who was even knowledgeable about the patricia kane protocol and to whom we went for iv glutathione infusions. i heard there were other practitioners who did hyperbaric oxygen therapy for lyme there too, but we never tried that. this was much more medical support than we had in ohio. my ``lyme'' doctor at that time was in connecticut and we had phone consultations with him. he was a whiz about antibiotics but did not do or know much about any alternative therapies. that year, i continued rigorous antibiotic treatment, trying different combinations. i took numerous antibiotics and meds during this ordeal, including bicillin injections, and the mepron yellow paint which literally broke the bank since i had no prescription coverage.  in may, i graduated law school and got married. a few months later i took the bar exam. although i could think again enough to finish law school and study for and pass the bar, i still felt very sick. the antibiotics clearly helped but fell far short of any kind of cure. also, when i tried to take breaks from antibiotics during that second year of treatment, i had to start them again very quickly because i would just slip and get worse. i lost hope that i would ever reach a point where i would go a day feeling energetic and normal and not having to think about this dreaded disease and i never thought i would be able to stop antibiotics for lyme.  after i took the bar, my mother suggested a radical step of going to germany for treatment with the bionic 880 photon therapy

"robert ""bob"" schneider, 63, indiana  http://www.courierpress.com/news/2006/aug/20/tick-talk/""""comments  evansville courier & press evansville in august 20, 2006  family blames member's death on tickborne illness  by libby keeling courier & press staff writer 464-7450 or keelingl@courierpress.com originally published 12:00 a.m., august 20, 2006 updated 11:30 p.m., august 19, 2006  robert ""bob"" schneider collapsed in his spencer county home july 5. two days later, neighbors found him lying on the floor where he had fallen.  the former evansville resident was hospitalized for more than 25 days before his death aug. 2 at st. mary's medical center.  he was admitted to the intensive care unit with multiple organ and respiratory failure, low blood platelet levels, altered mental status and septic shock, a condition occurring when massive infection results in low blood pressure and flow.  members of his family are convinced omplications of rocky mountain spotted fever caused his death. although an initial positive laboratory test for the tickborne bacterial illness was not confirmed prior to his death, schneider's son said medical staff found an embedded deceased tick and a live tick crawling on his 63-year-old father's body.  ""the signs and symptoms all point to it,"" said trent schneider, 40. ""i found out, that like colds or flu, children and elderly people are its prey, per se - the people most likely to develop severe complications.""  when identified in early stages, rocky mountain spotted fever typically is a highly treatable disease. its initial symptoms, however, are vague and flu-like, which complicates diagnosis.  many people who develop the disease after receiving a tick bite are hospitalized. without timely and appropriate antibiotic treatment, rocky mountain spotted fever can be fatal.  sudden fever, intense headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain and confusion are among the first signs of infection. many - but not all - people develop a rash after the initial onset of symptoms. abdominal pain, achy joints and diarrhea may occur.  if the disease progresses without treatment, the bacteria can attack and damage cells in the blood vessels. that damage allows blood to leach into nearby tissues. leaking blood can be responsible for the rash. it also can damage tissues and organs.  ""the tests came back and he did test positive for rocky mountain spotted fever,"" said judy schneider kron, his younger sister. ""the medical staff at st. mary's was absolutely wonderful. they worked so hard to save his life.""  schneider's family has been working to reconstruct the chain of events leading to his hospitalization.  trent schneider said he spoke with his father on the telephone shortly before july 4. during that conversation, his dad said he had been feverish and not feeling well for a few weeks.  the elder schneider, a decorated vietnam veteran, made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain treatment at the veteran's administration outpatient clinic in evansville, according to his son.  on july 5, he was diagnosed with sinusitis at a deaconess urgent care center before collapsing at his home later that evening, trent schneider said. two days later, neighbors found his father, still on the floor.  an ambulance took him to perry county memorial hospital in tell city, ind. the next morning he was taken by helicopter to st. mary's medical center. the family did not learn of his hospitalization until after his admission to the evansville hospital, schneider said.  his dad was having difficulty breathing and could not speak when schneider first saw him at st. mary's. the news was grim: bob schneider had a 40 percent chance of survival.  ""i saw my dad with a mask on and he was sitting there upright and he was huffing and puffing and his eyes were about as big as half dollars,"" schneider said. ""you could see the fear in his eyes.""  before the end of the day, schneider said his father was placed on a ventilator, the ticks were discovered and antibiotic treatment for tickborne infection was initiated. ""if anything, bob was healthy. he was a procrastinator and he procrastinated too long on this one,"" kron said through tears. ""... people need to check for ticks. that's the important part."" she believes the ticks on her brother's body likely came from his small farm in evanston, ind.  after retiring from his position as a social worker at evansville state hospital about 12 years ago, he moved to the property on the spencer-perry county line.  with the exception of a few good days when he squeezed her hand or responded to conversations with eye movements, kron said her brother remained unresponsive as doctors worked to improve his deteriorating condition and ascertain its cause. ""a tick. a little tick,"" kron said. ""i think my brother and my nephew really were the ones that said this is serious. we need to get the word out.""  although trent schneider authorized st. mary's physicians involved in his father's care to speak about the case, requests for comment received no response.  according to bob schneider's medical records - provided to the evansville courier & press by his son - doctors were still considering tickborne illness as a potential underlying cause of his systemic infection three days before he died. schneider's records indicate he tested positive for both rocky mountain spotted fever and erlichiosis, another related tickborne disease. a second test for rocky mountain spotted fever was ordered july 24. the results of that test are not included in his medical records.  physician's notes, however, indicate rocky mountain spotted fever was considered more of a possibility than erlichiosis, but neither appears to have been considered a conclusive diagnosis.  schneider said a doctor told him a positive test for rocky mountain spotted fever could indicate previous rather than current disease, but no other potential underlying cause for his father's illness was offered. a physician also said an autopsy would be inconclusive, according to schneider.  no evidence of prior rocky mountain spotted fever infection exists in bob schneider's records at the va medical center in marion, ill., according to information requested by his son. irreversible brain damage, hypertension (more likely hypotension, based on his medical records), sepsis with multi-organ dysfunction and a severe lung problem were reported as his cause of death, according to the vanderburgh county health department. his death certificate does not mention rocky mountain spotted fever.  ""i can't say if he did or didn't have it,"" said dr. lloyd mcginnis, health officer for the spencer county health department.  a state epidemiologist characterized the three potential cases of rocky mountain spotted fever reported this year in spencer county as previous, not current, infections, mcginnis said. other tests or clinical observations could change that impression, he added.  in the days before his death, bob schneider reached near complete organ failure. his blood pressure became dangerously low, and his white blood cell level plummeted. the prognosis was dismal.  ""i went in and talked to him. i said, 'you know, it's not looking very good,'"" trent schneider recalled. ""i told him i loved him very much. i wasn't ready for him to go, but you know, i told him that i felt that he was suffering and we needed to let him go.""  kron said her brother watched what he ate, exercised and was aware of the risks of tick exposure.  ""he was very careful, very careful, about checking himself for ticks,"" she said. ""if you have any of the symptoms of fever, rash, tiredness, whatever, they may be any of the tickborne illnesses. immediately get to your doctor."""^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^^0^0
"i was reflecting today on our journey with lyme disease. reflecting on the pain, the fear, the doubt.... ....the ups, the downs, the sideways...and then the joys... its been a very long journey, some of you know us well, others are new here. when we started our journey it was full of hope, and we felt refreshed. somewhere along the way, we found that many of those we spoke with three years ago, have gone on. either became frustrated and quit, or became well and dont visit the board too often. those who became well, we quickly have forgotten about, and the board is filled with others who are too, just beginning the journey. those who became frustrated, began jumping from treatment to treatment in hopes of finding a cure. in hopes of living their dreams of a fullfilled life, free of pain, free of random thoughts on top of random thoughts that come so fast you forget the ""main thought"" which was not random at all... while our journey is still in progress, i have been in prayer regarding sharing, being careful not to take the credit our selves, but to thank god every day for the special people who have interceded in our daily life, to make it a bit better for us. dr. jones, sabra and his full staff. some are no longer there, but we love them all. tincup, lda, and so many more. ultimately god brought them in to our lives, and have helped heal us. today, i think back when we first got bit...and got sick. my gut said lyme. my docter said no. 8 years later after almost loosing our 12 yr old daughter to congestive heart failure due to her arrhithmya from lyme disease, watching her hobble like an old lady, and crying her to sleep at night, holding her up in the day to do basic tasks like eating, and wondering if she would live another year (according to her neurologist and cardiologist she would not!) and not even knowing if i should pray for life, death or healing (we had prayed for healing for so long we began to think it was not gods will) for my daughter....we found she had lyme, erlichia and babesia. our daughter had brief periods of remission during her 8 year ordeal, which brought hope. it also brought frustration, because they would be followed by bouts of health much worse that what we had already experienced. after tincup so lovingly referred us...(yes, with a rolling pin in her hand ready to pop me over the head if i said no!).... to dr. jones, we knew that life would be much better. to our surprise, we were terribly terribly wrong. our daughter began treatment, and she became unable to be on her feet very long. her pain now was about 30 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst. the next 12 months of our lives were spent with her in bed nearly 22 hours a day. she cried at night...she cried at day and she tore our hearts apart. so many times i wanted to stop treatment...so many times she begged to stop treatment. but we all would remember the path we had been on. we began to justify that path wasnt so bad...was it??? not nearly this bad... but 8 months in, we literally woke up one day with a daughter who was like all the other teens. it lasted a short while, and she drifted back into her body riddle with pain. but this brief glimpse, was enough to carry us on with more demand for a healthy life. i researched more, we spend thousands of dollars to see the best...and dr. jones patiently waited. documenting small positive changes that were difficult for us to realize.. the many trips to the er, became one long fuzzy year...and i began to doubt again. was this ever going to end? was this a big lie? should we quit antibiotics? i went to our internal med doc, and asked her to do a full body scan. i knew my daughter must have cancer. leukemia had been a possibility before her lyme diagnosis. please check her again. i know we are dealing with something else. the gracious doctor did every test she could. she began implementing new pain therapies. but she told us, that she had seen improvement, even if we didnt. she had faith in dr. jones, and gods answers through doctor jones, for healing for our daughter. she kept us on track with the therapy, herself curious to see if ""this would really work"". our final ""tempation"" to stop all therapy came with the most severe, debilitating headache one could imagine. our daughter would writhe in pain, after 100 mg of iv demerol, her body would continue to spasm from the severe pain in the spine and head. for nearly 6 weeks, we made the local er our every other night travel. they finally decided to do a spinal tap, to see if she had intracranial pressure. the spinal tap, although showed no signs of increased pressure, immediatly removed the headache, and she felt a warm sensation at the base of her head. since that day, her headaches may begin, but relieve easily with over the counter pain medication. she has not been in the hospital with debilitating headaches since then and her body started to show significant healing. she began physical therapy two weeks later, and has continued building her tissues that connect muscles and bones. her pain is under control. yes she still gets tired, ....but wouldnt you after rock climbing 15 hours a week, e skating once or twice and week, and doing your school work? oh yeah, she is retaining her school work too! our road to recovery is still in progress. we attribute the excellent recovery so far to answers from prayer from many of you and us on behalf of our daughter, excellent doctors who really care,good diets, and a young lady who never gave up or jumped from protocol to protocol, but followed the llmds advice, even when it seemed the rock wall we were climbing was too tall with too few holds.  i know this is long, but i really wanted to share, to give hope, and to help those debating if they should continue or stop treatment, to choose the advice of their llmd. i hope and pray for all of you on this board, that you will continue to heal. love, theresa ps. i am waiting for horse show photos from this past weekend. i will post an addition to her success here when i get those back!"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"can i add my success story? a year ago, i could not move my left arm due to synovitis and multiple joint pain that kept me awake at night. i often had to retreat to bed from fatigue. i could not walk up my stairs without extreme effort. i had the full gamut of neurological involvement, from insomnia and cognitive processing problems, memory loss, hallucinations, psychiatric symptoms looking like ptsd, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and depression, shooting pains, facial and ear pain, hypoglycemia at coma levels, and much more. today i can walk for miles, ski for hours, do household chores, perform my work, and everyone who sees me remarks on how well i look. i would say i am 85%. i still have neuropathy and have to take anti-seizure meds and mobic for inflammation. i have occasional memory black holes and word-flipping errors when stressed. i am on my third round of orals, but no anti-depressants, and my mood is just fine, thank you. i went undiagnosed for four years, and when i finally came to lymenet and saw my same symptoms being discussed by many similarly afflicted, i knew i had found the culprit. i went to a llmd, told him about my big red rash that i once thought was insignificant. he took a history of my symptoms, ran tests or looked at recent ones done by others --western blot, pcr, mri, spect scan, echocardiogram-- all confirmed my diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. i am not cured entirely, but the level of my progress allows me to resume nearly a normal life--doing what i enjoy. i am not quite up to driving speed, but someday soon, i will be, i think. i tend to think i will have to manage this for life, that i will never be 100% ""safe"" in thinking i am cured. but if i can manage it at this level, i will continue to be a functioning, tax-paying member of society again."^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"i have lyme, although only band 41 showed up on my test, and later 83-93 ind from igenex. i pulled a nymph deer tick off me and got lyme symptoms a week later. my gp tried to convince me that it couldn't be lyme, so it must be a summer virus and i should just take advil and ignore it and it would go away.  she was wrong--i'm still sick and being treated (by an llmd) 14 months later, making slow but positive progress. (well, fast progress compared to some, who waited much longer than me to start treatment and then took years instead of months to start seeing improvement.)  my ebv test came back very high. lyme inhibits your immune system, so latent viruses often take the opportunity to come out and play. if they cause you any symptoms, those may come and go depending on how well your immune system is dealing with them at the time.  they usually go dormant again when the lyme and coinfections are successfully treated.  lyme is a clinical diagnosis, so you need an experienced llmd to diagnose you by your symptoms and history. you don't need a positive test at all to be diagnosed with and treated for lyme.  the lyme tests often come back negative in people who really do have lyme, and uninformed mainstream doctors use those results to deny them diagnosis and treatment, and then they get a lot sicker down the road.  existing tests miss many people with lyme. false negatives are common. false positives are very rare. in addition, you are having lyme-like symptoms, so that plus a positive elisa test equals lyme.  unfortunately, the political situation surrounding lyme disease results in many uninformed doctors telling patients that their positive lyme test must be a false positive, even in the face of lyme symptoms and possibly a known tick bite and/or an em rash.  this is because a group of doctors associated with the infectious disease society of america (idsa) deny the existence of chronic lyme disease. if you stand there in front of one of them with chronic lyme disease, they will say you have something else or it's all in your head, because they can't admit the existence of the illness.  if the rash you had on your elbow was an em (lyme) rash, that alone is enough to diagnose you with lyme.  lyme can cause a huge variety of symptoms, and can cause or imitate lupus and many other conditions that people are misdiagnosed with when they really have lyme.  many people are misdiagnosed for years and years with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ms, als, parkinson's, alzheimer's, and other conditions, and then told there is nothing to be done about it, when really they had lyme all along, which is treatable.  or worse, they are given steroids for an ""autoimmune"" condition, which lowers their immune system and makes their lyme much worse and much harder to cure. do not take steroids if there is any chance you have lyme, until you consult an llmd.  watch the video ""under our skin"" www.underourskin.com or read the book ""cure unknown"" by pamela weintraub to understand how lyme disease works and how this unfortunate political situation came about.  in the meantime, run, don't walk, to the nearest llmd. it is expensive, and unfairly so, but the cost of not getting treated is much greater. the disease can get so much worse if untreated, and the longer treatment is delayed, the more time and money it will take to get better. early, proper treatment (from an llmd) is a good investment.  you cannot have ""borderline"" lyme. either the bacteria is present or it isn't. if you have lyme symptoms and a test indicating you have antibodies to the lyme bacteria (=positive elisa), then an experienced llmd will be very likely to conclude that you have lyme.  -------------------- don't forget to laugh! and when you're going through hell, keep going!  bitten 5/25/2009 in perry county, indiana. diagnosed by llmd 12/2/2009."^0^1^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"i got lyme in my early teens and started regularly using the sauna in my mid 20s. it did help a great deal keeping me functional and reducing symptoms but i slowly continued to get sicker. i didn't know i had lyme at this point so i tried a number of nutritional approaches to try to remedy my failing health.  i tried food elimination diets, scd diet, paleo, gaps, a 6 months raw food diet. none of them was a game changer, although i think the raw food diet along with tons of zeolite and msm did reduce my heavy metal toxicity.  note that the diet dr wilson's recommends is pretty much the opposite of the diet used by the paracelsus institute mentioned in another post: ""yang helps. in addition to the use of heat to kill of the parasites, making the body more yang is another key to success. to do this, the diet is most important, especially avoiding vegetarian diets, raw food diets, and foods such as fruits and all other sugars.""  i took a ton of immune boosters and all sorts of mushroom products without any kind of a herx reaction.  the thing i finally tried which created a huge reaction and immediate (but temporary) improvement in symptoms was topically applied essential oils. i had a major herx and detox reaction and after years of trying things that had no effect whatsoever i was just like, wtf was that!  so i just kept using the oils and my immune system woke up in a big way and started fighting on it's own. week by week i slowly made progress and my symptoms began to disappear. i think killing agents can really be the key to alerting the body to the fact that there is a stealthy invader that has been flying under the radar for far to long.  when i finally got a lyme test it was positive by cdc standards, something i doubt would have been the case had i tested prior to using essential oils. i decided to not use antibiotics and haven't, as i had found some effective killing agents already."^0^1^1^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0
"""undertreated infections will inevitably resurface"" (p. 3 of burrascano guidelines)  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  so, i agree with your lyme doctor: you either did not treat your lyme and coinfections sufficiently so they continued to progress, or you may have gotten bitten again.  either way, i strongly suggest you go to a lyme doctor who follows the burrascano protocol.  if you have never read burrascano's guidelines, i strongly suggest that you read and study them. i understand not wanting to take high-dose antibiotics, and burrascano says you must take them in combinations, but with this horrendous disease, it is often necessary.  also, were you checked for the various coinfections and treated for all that you had? were you tested for babesiosis, bartonella, etc. and were you questioned about the symptoms of these diseases?  burrascano says that anyone who has lyme for at least a year also has coinfections--100% of the time.  if you don't treat and get rid of every single infection that tick gave you, then you will never get rid of the lyme. these diseases help one another remain entrenched in our bodies. many of them compromise our immune system, so the antibiotics and special exercise program are required to get us back to normal.  i advise everyone to get to the very best lyme specialist they can afford. see support groups on the left side of this page. contact the ones in connecticut. find out who the good doctors are. go to the best you can and do everything they tell you to do.  burrascano was the """"1 lyme disease doctor on the planet when he was treating. they came from every country on the planet to see him. he says you must treat until symptom-free and then treat at least 2 months more in a case like yours where your lyme has gone on for years.  that is how i got rid of lyme disease.  i first wasted 2 years with a lousy lyme doctor. i made some progress with him, but then i began to get new, horrendous symptoms. according to burrascano, because my therapy was inadequate, my disease was continuing to progress.  then, i switched to a doc who followed burrascano. he told me that i would never get well unless i did the burrascano exercise program. he treated me as per burrascano and i obeyed all the rules including the 1 continuous hour of weightlifting (a full body workout each time) every other day.  in 8 months i was symptom free. my doc kept me on antibiotics for 5 more months (until winter was over). that was over 10 years ago and i am still symptom free.  i had lyme, babesiosis, and bartonella. i was undiagnosed for at least 10 years. still, with good treatment, i recovered and have stayed recovered.  here are a few points from dr. b's guidelines:  you must attack both the regular and cyst (or other) form of lyme simultaneously--requires at least 2 different antibiotics taken together to do so.  you must test the patient for all co-infections and other physical ailments (thyroid, etc.) and treat everything the person has.  you must treat all co-infections the patient has (including babesiosis, bartonella, ehrlichia, mycoplasma, etc.) or the patient will not get well.  you must use igenex for most of these tests--they are a tick-borne disease speciality lab in calif.  you must use very high doses of antibiotics to kill the diseases (batericidal doses).  you must give the patient supplements, probiotics, herbs such as artimesinin if babesiosis is suspected, and require adherence to rules such as low carb diet, no alcohol, no smoking, rest, and exercise as the patient is able to do it.  you must treat at least 2 months after all symptoms have disappeared (if sick at least 1 year).  these are just a few of the important points you will see in the guidelines. if possible, you want a doc who does everything burrascano says to do. he treated lyme for over 25 years, and compiled what he learned so that other docs could benefit from it. he was the most successful lyme doctor on the planet.  welcome to lymenet! we will help you here all we can!"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
there is most certainly hope. i lost my job, my friends, my marriage and my life due to 14 years of undiagnosed lyme. after my diagnosis in 2001, i was on iv antibiotics for 8 months and oral for quite a while. i am an ultrasound tech by trade and was unable to work at all for almost 3 years at the end.  today i live at the beach, enjoy being single for the first time in 20 years, and work full time in my profession again. am i 100%? no. but i am med free!! i was on fetenyl patches and oxy ir for break through pain for 8 years. i was diagnosed bi-polar due to this illness. i as on anti depressants and lithium just to name a few meds-they used to total over 15 of them. i take nothing stronger than an occasional advil and some melatonin for sleep. i still run tired at times and am sore after a 12 hour shift at work, but i am not flat on my back crying any more!

"first off, i want thank dr. h, dr. s, dr. b for never giving up on us that have chronic lyme, they are my heroes.  i think with dr. h's extreme success with dapsone and stevia together, there could be a possible cure on the horizon, let me ellaborate.    i've had lyme for around 6 years, made some progress with flagyl, but plateud. before taking dapsone and stevia together, i was about 80-90%, after taking dapsone and stevia i felt 100% for a whole two weeks, then kind of got fatigued and bottomed out.  probably because i wasn't taking enough folic acid, dr. h recommends around 30mg, if you look at what the traditional tablet is at the store, yeah that's a lot. so i upped my dosing, feel so much better.  so after taking dapsone and stevia together, i've gotten my life back. i'm clear headed now, i have tons energy, and feel great. this isn't the typical bs people claim with other controversial treatment, this is the best i've ever felt treating this disease.  now i know that some people think stevia can't get to the blood, i thought that too, ""i was wrong!!!!"" buy the sweetleaf stevia concentrate from amazon, wholefoods, or better health, it's very cheap, only like $10-$15, and it's super pure and raw, totally dark.  what you do is, put 5-10 drops underneath your tongue for like 30+ seconds, then swallow. i tried doing this without taking dapsone, i hit the ground with instant fatigue, i couldn't get off the couch for 3 days straight. that's until i paired it up with 25mg of dapsone.  i did it with dapsone, immediately afterwards i got a bursts of energy i never fealt in my entire life, i got on the treadmill ran like 5 miles. so that told me something right there.  after being on dapsone and this protocol for about a month, i've never felt so great in my entire life.  now i know dapsone has extreme side effects, especially when paired up with other antibiotics, that can extremely increase the chances of hypertensitiviy, but if you take a low dose of 25mg a day and that's it, less chance of getting side effects.  and i've found that sulfa drug like dapsone has long half life in my body, it builds up for 2-4 weeks, so you might have to take a break in there, like a week, along with keep taking stevia.  dr. h uses dapsone with other abx, which can increase the chances of hypersensitivity and side effects, i don't think it's needed. i know he does this for coinfections, but dapsone already is a antiparasitic/antibacteria drug like flagyl, so it could be possibly treating coinfections already.  and for those of you that don't want to risk it, you could try the other mycobacterium drug pyrazinamide, which might have less side effects. i've also been having really good success and herxes using brown sugar in clear capsules with stevia.  here's a story for ya, i was on flagyl+ceftin+doxy for whole month once, when i was eating honey bunches of oats maple brown sugar i was herxing like crazy, couldn't figure out why, but i couldn't pinpoint what it was, i just knew it was something in honey bunches of oats maple brown sugar, i thought i was crazy. so i kept eating it, i felt the most energy and clear headedness i felt in years, until i tried dapsone and stevia.  but something was working, just this past week i pinpointed what it was, it was the brown sugar. i'm not sure if it's just the molasses in brown sugar that brought out the bacteria, i ended up going to the store and buying some raw molasses putting it into capsules and then taking little dapsone, worked little, but not as efficiently.  so what i'm assuming is was, it's the combination of the sugar and molasses, that forms the sweetness to the brown sugar that drives out the borrelia bacteria.  if you think i'm full of bs, you need to look up some of the recent studies done on using sugar and antbiotics together on antibiotic resistant forms of bacteria. if you've read the recent article on dr. s, this is how she stumbled on stevia, thinking it may trick the bacteria and help bust up biofilms.  all the work that dr. s and dr. h have been doing together has been working, i'm not kidding you, i'm a prime example, along with others who are sharing their results on dr. h's facebook page. i posted up there if you want to see what i've said, as well as some of his other patients. https://www.facebook.com/drrichardhorowitz/posts/1430152257073568?comment_id=1430859813669479&ref=notif�if_t=like�if_id=1500267592114901  anyways, just to far warn everyone, do not take dapsone or any other mycobacterium drugs with out lyme literate doctor supervision and supervision without bloodwork.  dapsone has to be taken with high doses of folic acid, dr. h recommends up to 30mg a day, so buy a brand that has 800mcg and above if you can find it.  this is such great news, i think that it's possible within the next few years a cure for borreliosis could hit the market. this may work on patients with parkinsons and alzheimers as well, like dr. m said with the plaques and nematodes.  dr. h and i have been having great results with just the oral form, just imagine if a lab were able to compound it into a drug for lets say, taking intravenously for more potency and penetration.  it's been 2 years since the article put up on dr. s testing the curza cz-1-99 drug, i'm curious when that's going to hit the market, said it worked 60% better. and i'm curious how well stevia could work pairted up with lets say bee venom.  all i know is, the fda has approved opioids, psych meds, and glyphosate for the market, yet those two are killing people by the 100s of thousands, when are these biofilm antibiotics like curza and agile sciences� agilyte technology going to hit the market? people are dieing and committing suicide by lyme.  anyways, i didn't want to share my results with everyone until i knew what i was feeling was consistent. what i mean was, it wasn't like flagyl, where i felt better for a month and made some progress and that was it. i've found being on and off this protocol for 2 months now, that i get continuous herxing, as well as making progress.  for those that are in the earlier stages of treatment, using stevia/brown sugar and dapsone or flagyl or tindamax may create an incredible herx.  herxes for me weren't bad, i just felt dizziness, pins needles, and muscle twitching. i know for other people, like women, it causes extreme pain and epilepsy, so start of slow.  i also want to say, i'm a bodybuilder and athlete myself, one thing i've found in life is, you never can give up! and i like to add that the internet saved my life, i paired up my symptoms with the sympoms on the canlyme.com website.  and just so you know, the current presidency is looking to end net neutrality, which keeps a level playing field for small websites like canlyme.com, which helped saved my life. be sure to protest ajit pai's decision to end net neutrality.  we all know doctors hate the internet because we bring them new scientific studies, but ya know what, that's their fault for not staying up to date with the latest breakthroughs in science! this is the last freedom we have, don't let the internet go to waste!!!!!!!  any questions, don't be afraid to ask.... again, for those scared of trying dapsone or pyrazinamide, you could try the sweetleaf stevia concentrate with fagyl+doxy or flagyl+doxy+ceftin see how it works.  i don't think dr. s and dr. h exactly know why the antiparasitic/antibacteria drugs work so well on lyme, maybe because it's hitting all coinfections at once. not sure, but i don't think flagyl or tindamax ever ended up on the persister cell list done by john hopkins study.  and don't forget to try brown sugar in some clear capsules, i used the domino brown sugar, it's like $2 at meijer. and bought some now empy capsules from whole foods. i wouldn't waste money on the overhyped overpriced nutramedix stevia...  take care and hope this helps people. and for those of you that failed with dapsone, just so you know, taking it alone for me didn't do much. it with stevia is what causes the breakthrough in treatment for me.  i'm also curious how well this sweetleaf concentrate/brown sugar would work with daptomycin, one of popular antibiotics that showed to kill persister cells in the hopkins study.

phenomenal article, now people have a great article to give to their friends, family, and doctors that are in denial. i love the title!!!  remember denieing chronic lyme disease, is denieing science.  doctors and scientists are so blatantly pushing the science behind climate change, which i fully support, but where are they on chronic lyme disease, when the science is out... especially when millions are suffering and thousands have died, oh my the ignorance and hypocrisy from the scientific community!  i lost a good portion of my 30s because of this disease and the greed, ignorance, and corruption over at the cdc. i sure hope someone serves time for this. i've already seen how they tried to throw corruption under the rug with flint water crisis in my home town.  i've been using the antibiotics mentioned in the article and studies, having a lot of success with stevia, the enzymes from liverite liver aid, even using special fx cbd oil from a local dispensary here in michigan... the cbd oil i use actually has cinnamon in it too, remember what the article pointing to another article said about cinnamon bark. we already know through research that cannibnoids like cbd and thc are antibacterial, so this is a double whammy if you can find a cbd tincture with cinnamon in it. these 3 really been helping me with biofilms...... i want to try oregano oil next... but as i've found out, you must pair them up with strong antibiofilm antibiotics in order to get the full effect, like tindamax and flagyl.  i've been using stevia with doxy/ceftin/tindamax... i swear to god i can feel the brain fog, pins and needles, and weird tingling feeling of the biofilms expanding and contracting when using these antibiotics in my joints.  i've been treating for this disease for 6 years, i've never felt these expanding and contracting feelings i'm getting when i treat with these antibiotics and biofilm busters. i've tried nattokinase and serrapeptase, earlier in my treatment, but never felt what i've feeling now.  dapsone has extremely helped me, but be careful with this drug, extremely toxic. the half life is a lot longer than what scientist and doctors say it is. i've changed my stance on this drug, it has helped me progress amazingly, but just be careful with it!!!  the borrelia bacteria is more resiellient than one could ever imagine, this has to be the most intelligent bacteria on this planet. it literally knows when to throw up it's self defense mechanisms(when you start taking antibiotics) and it knows when to come out of hiding when you stop.

"you will continue to accumulate neuro symptoms and other types of symptoms because your lyme/bart/babs is progressing.  you must get to someone very good as soon as possible. and, don't let this happen again. i don't know why you stopped treatment with dr. p. in the past, but perhaps you stopped before you were cured.  perhaps dr. p. will not make you wait in line for 1 year since you were his patient before. i strongly suggest you call there and see if they will fit you in.  he may not even charge you the new patient fee for first appointment. some lyme docs will treat you as an ""old"" patient and do these things for a person.  dr. p is so highly thought of, i sure hope he will take you back right away. just in case he won't, i am sending you the name of a top notch doctor that i suggest you contact.  jump on this!  i am female. when i had lyme, it totally destroyed me in the sexual area--with terrible bodily symptoms that made sex impossible and in other ways. it shrunk my ovaries to nothing and stopped them from producing all female sex hormones.  so, lyme is well capable of doing the ed thing and much, much more.  you don't have ms and don't need a neurologist. if you go to one, i predict you will be very sorry. they always or nearly always treat lyme patients terrible. i still remember how the one i saw treated me.  you can get your normal life back, but the doc is the key. i am a success story. lyme stole 5 to 10 years of my life. but, no more. i am 12 years symptom free, enjoying my life, same brain and same life i had before lyme disease.  that can be you also.  study the burrascano guidelines section on ""rehabilitation."" it tells you that to prevent a relapse, you must boost your immune system. you do this by doing a 1 continuous hour program of weightlifting every other day. you do a full body workout each time using light weights and many repetitions.  this is the key to not getting this disease back again ever again. antibiotics are not enough.  see this quote:  ""lyme disease rehabilitation  despite antibiotic treatments, patients will not return to normal unless they exercise, so therefore an aggressive rehab program is absolutely necessary. it is a fact that a properly executed exercise program can actually go beyond the antibiotics in helping to clear the symptoms and to maintain a remission.  although the scientific basis for the benefits of exercises is not known, there are several reasonable theories."" (p. 31)  he then goes on to explain how this specific exercise--weightlifting for 1 hour every other day--is likely boosting the immune system of the person so that these horrendous diseases are not able to come back on you.  the lyme doc that cured me told me at my very first appointment that i would never get rid of lyme if i did not do this exercise program. it worked for me wonderfully. and, others i know who are cured give the credit to weightlifting (or pilates) for the fact that they have never relapsed."^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
- because lyme is just so very toxic, that is why it may cause a rise in porphyrins for many patients. this article may help shine some light on the toxicity connection:  www.townsendletter.com/febmar2006/lyme0206.htm  from the townsend letter for doctors & patients, february/march 2006   biochemistry of lyme disease: borrelia burgdorferi spirochete / cyst  by prof. robert w. bradford and henry w. allen  excerpts: . . .  a discovery of great importance relating to a toxin produced by the causative agent of lyme disease, borrelia burgdorferi, has been linked to a similar toxin produced by the organism clostridium botulinum (botulism). . . .

hi folks:  i�ve been treating lyme and co since first becoming ill in 2010. so it has now been about 7 years and 2 months.  i�m better off than most. i went from nearly bedbound in 2010 after 4 months of misdiagnosis, to 90+% in only 3-4 months treatment. but i�ve never been able to get to a full 100% remission, although i�ve had years at 95% or so before backsliding in late 2015 and crawling my way back to 90% in early 2017.  along the way i�ve changed llmd�s several times. i went from my first llmd in ma (dr. h) who saved my life to the famous dr. h in ny who treated very aggressively to my now llmd dr. m in ct. (who also is well known nationally and gives lectures etc.) i did a lot of work last year with a good applied kinesiologist in nyc who helped me crawl back from my relapse in late 2015.  anyway, as someone whose been in this for now 7+ years, it seems to me that this illness is getting more difficult to treat. there seems to be fewer and fewer success stories that you used to see in years past. examples are tf, sixgoofykids, etc.  i�m not sure if this is because there is less activity on lymenet now versus years past (presumably due to more communities on facebook etc where people are posting), or if it is because the bugs are evolving, new germs are now involved, and previous treatments are less effective.  i�ve read how people like tf have gotten well. i�ve done those same dr. b protocols with famous llmd�s. they definitely helped but didn�t get me all the way well. it seems the bugs are getting resistant to those treatments, babesia in particular. there seem to be newer, unidentified pathogens like protomyxzoa that are causing problems.  to me, it seems abx alone are no longer working. you now need an integrated approach of abx, herbs, nutrition, energy testing, etc. these are the success stories as of late. doctors like dr. c in pa or dr. k in wa take this approach. also stories of folks getting well after decades by doing herbs and diet and parasite tx like on www.realfoodrebel.com  anyway, these are just my observations.  what do you all think? do you think the bugs and changed and previously effective treatments are no longer as effective? thoughts?  as for me, i'm doing better than most. 90% most days but still have nuisance symptoms i'm trying to clear. tinnitus, twitching, occasional fogginess which is now mostly gone, thankfully. my journey continues....  -------------------- bite date ? 2/10 symptoms began 5/10 dx'd, after 3 months numerous test and doctors  igm igenex +/cdc + + 23/25, 30, 31, 34, 41, 83/93  currently on:  currently at around 80% +/- most days.^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
thanks... i know i always felt better when eating a plan similar to this.  my first success was with the atkins diet... really felt so much better and was in control of my intake of foods!  --------------------  oops! --lymetutu-- opinions, not medical advice!^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0
so i talked to a lady in aizona that was so sick she could not leave her house for 5 years. at a point of no hope she tried a mild hyperbaric chamber for 1 hour per day. she felt no difference first 60 days and was ready to quit but persisted. 8 months later she was back to the health before lyme. anybody try this with this level of committment. i wonder if you could combine this with photon therapy?^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
hi all:))  ive been wanting to write in here for so long but have been feeling cautious not wanting to jinx my recovery or make any bold statements about being well. so i gave it more time and feel like its time now to write:) i got lyme at age 19 but went undiagnosed for 10 years during which i made it through university by the skin of my teeth and then afterwards got extremely ill and spent several years bedbound, in extreme pain, with severe stomach issues, barely able to speak. i couldnt watch tv or read or do anything really as it all made the pain worse. the only thing i could do was listen to audiobooks, they helped alot. i finally got diagnosed with lyme 2 years ago after seeing the discovery health episode on lyme and also reading a few different people's accounts on the internet of the unreliability of lyme testing. i had been tested twice with the basic elisa and had been negative both times. i was lucky to find an amazing lyme doc and for the first time with a doc to be in really good hands. my recovery was tough but i was so happy to finally know what was wrong with me. i felt some improvement initially and got big herx reactions so i felt i was on the right track. mostly on treatment i felt pretty crappy, i was able to be up and about around the house but was feeling pretty rough still most days. i did 9 months of iv treatment and that seemed to help clear the brain fog. then earlier this year i was treated again for babesia and also started a supplement called d-ribose both of which dramatically helped my energy levels and general feeling of wellbeing. i improved so much that by early summer i was able to return to work and ive been working now all summer, doing 40 hour weeks and feeling better and better over time. i still have along way to go, im working on my adrenals which have taken a beating due to the lyme and also have alot of stomach issues from all the antibiotics but i have a great naturopath who is also helping with those issues. im on the buhner protocol now and do a small dose each day of colloidal silver recommended by my lyme doctor. i still have to be very careful not to overdo it and to take it fairly easy at the weekends. i still do my epsom salt/hydrogen peroxide baths and take all my suportive supplements so i have a really good support network. i couldnt have gotten through this illness without the love and support of my family and an amazing boyfriend who has stayed with my through the entire illness despite the fact the i had to move to live with my parents and he was far away in london, uk. so many times i hoped i would get better but with so many days of feeling awful during the recovery process i wondered was it ever going to happen. i would notice small improvements and wanted to believe that they meant something positive but thought maybe i was just imagining it. however they have continued to add up over time and i am getting better and better every day. i just wanted to write this for anyone out there who is in an earlier stage of recovery than i am, i know how rough it is and how hopeless it can make you feel trying to keep going in this ongoing battle but there is light at the end of the tunnel, you will get there. my body has been through so much but i am healing every day. i know it ll be a long process to be fully healthy so i will continue to keep working at it but i am leading a much much more normal life now. im doing a very challenging job and planning a trip to my home country (ireland) for a week in oct. my boyfriend is moving to the us this year so we are finally going to be living together again. so many great things are happening so i try to remember that staying healthy depends on keeping a good work life balance, eating healthily and continuing with all the supportive supplements and therapies that have helped me to get well. sometimes (or maybe alot of the time) it means learning to put yourself and your health first in order to get the rest you need and learning to say no to things that you do not have the energy for.  so to anyone out there who is feeling hopeless, its tough and horrible alot of the time but you will get there and it will be more than worth it when you do so hang in there, never give up!  lots of love to all my fellow lymies, keep on keepin on;)  windmill^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"i think i'm a success story, though i'm not 100%. i think a tiny bit of antigen remaining is enough to drive the immune response, once it has got started, and if you have the wrong genes, you might continue to have arthritic problems or other problems. which is what happened to me.  i was finally diagnosed in '87 after 10 years of illness. i had ankylosing spondylitis, where the arthritis focuses on the spine/neck and gradually, painfully inflames and calcifies everything. once i got treated for the lyme which we believe triggered it, the process cooled off and slowed way down but did not entirely stop. i still have some joint ""issues.""  thank god for my llmd. before i met him i thought i would die young. three years into the treatment i could finally start planning my life ahead. i kept improving even after that. now i put in a more than full day! i'm very busy and feel great even though in the past few years i had tendons in my fingers rupture and also a torn rotator cuff. so i do have musculoskeletal issues, but they don't slow me down too much.  nowadays i love to sneeze. i remember when i couldn't sneeze, it hurt too much. i'm on maintenance doxycycline and as long as i am pretty faithful, i am fine. luckily doxy is cheap and safe.  i feel like i am one of the lucky ones. i love my work and although my life took an unexpected turn, i have met the most wonderful people and my life is happy and very rich. i am glad that i now have the opportunity to help other people find help, and also to try to work for solutions that will help my children and grandchildren. phyllis  -------------------- phyllis mervine lymedisease.org"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
finally, success!  i'm a frequent reader of this board, but haven't really posted much. i wanted to post my success story to share with everyone and let you know there's hope of getting better, it can happen.  i was diagnosed with lyme in may 2007 after being sick with strange symptoms for about 6 months. dizziness, jaw pain, confusion, brain fog, forgetfulness, arm pain, and extreme fatigue were my main symptoms. i never suspected lyme and was surprised when my doctor, who ran a bunch of tests, told me i had it. (i was one of the lucky ones who test positive)  i grew up in western pa and had heard about lyme disease, but the most i knew about it was something about a bulls-eye rash. i wasn't prepared for how sick i was about to get!  i'm so thankful to everyone on this board who provided lifesaving information for me!! you have all educated me about this disease, and about the nasty politics behind treatment. i've been able to pass along that knowledge to everyone i know (even when they don't ask!), and hopefully we can raise awareness about diagnosing and treating lyme.  back to my story - i was diagnosed in may 2007, started on oral antibiotics and sent to an infectious disease doc. i've heard the horror stories about them, but my doctor was amazing!!! he was knowledgeable about the disease and gave me iv rocephin, then continued with the orals after, until i got better.  it took about a year, but i'm so happy to say that i've been symptom-free for 4 months now!! completely healthy. i had gotten to the point where i didn't think this was a possibility - i thought that i would be sick forever.  keep fighting! i know how horrible this disease is, and i want you to know there's a light at the end of the tunnel. thank you to everyone on this board; you are all amazing people struggling with an awful disease. my prayers are with all of you to get better and to be able get back to a normal life. it can happen!^0^1^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"i'm a success story, as is my son! i have been meaning to come on here and post this, as i looked to this board for support during our ordeal last year!  we live in rural northeast nj - tick capital of the world! briefly, last may (2007) i began to have joint pain. i got more tired and lethargic and it all blew up around the fourth of july. i felt sick when i went to bed. an hour later i woke up shaking, dizzy, with sort of like tunnel vision - partial blacking out sort of thing. my pulse was rapid and i was nauseous but didn't throw up. i could not stop the feeling of shaking and these sort of muscles contractions where my muscles would tighten up every time i would try to rest. my husband took me to the emergency room. i was fed a bunch of lies by the er doctor who examined me and clearly gave me the feeling that i was wasting his time. he told me that he'd do a lyme test and if it was positive i'd find out in a few days and he sent me home.  my elisa came back negative and i went to my regular md who did a western blot. i continued to feel very very ill. i knew this was not a virus - i just absolutely 100 percent knew. western blot came back neg. i told my md that this had been going on for six weeks and could we just see if abx would clear it up? he refused, told me i was fine and healthy and that i'd get over it. never mind that in all my 11 years of going to him, i had never once asked him for any sort of antibiotics or medication for me or any of my four children.  but i was helpless, so i believed him and continued to go downward. i had floaters in my vision, brain fog, leg pain, especially in my hips and one leg, and all the other classic lyme symptoms. my husband, who did test positive for lyme, lied to our doctor and said that his pills fell in the toilet, and had it refilled for me. i took his amox and was better in a week. i had my life back! i finished the prescription and thought i was through with it all.  two weeks later it crept back. this time i went to a doctor in town who a friend recommended. he listened to me - really listened, and said that the tests don't mean squat and began me on abx again because he believed it was lyme. again, the amox wiped it out or so i thought.  meanwhile, my son was diagnosed through a positive blot in september of that year (three months after my symptoms began). he is allergic to amox and developed an allergic reaction to the doxy within two weeks. doctor began him on zithromax.  meanwhile, out of desperation, i made a decision that completely changed the course of our fate. i took my son and myself to our chiropractor/nutritionist. i knew from a friend who had been seeing him for her migraines that he might be able to help us. at first i laughed at her and his testing methods, but when he cured her migraines, i knew i had to try something because this was clearly not working for us.  he does nutrition response testing. he tweaked our systems with supplements and a very strict sugar free/low glycemic diet. this man struggled with lyme himself for a long time and he adopted these testing methods for the body when he himself was healed this way by another practitioner. when i began seeing him, i also realized that i was still not better and i was given a round of doxy. my son also, had his symptoms return and he went on zith again for a month.  when my prescription ran out, i was still symptomatic but not as bad as before. friends who had lyme encouraged me to call the doctor and see if he would give me more doxy. one friend even offered to get me doxy under the table if he wouldn't refill it. i struggled with asking for more meds or continuing with the diet and supplements and opted for the latter which did include a parasite removal program.  i am happy to say that within another couple of months i was symptom free and so is my son. i have not had any symptoms at all in five months. my son is no longer testing for bacteria in the nutritional response tests. was it cheap? no. was it easy? no- (try keeping an 8 year old away from sugar including fruit sugar!!) was it worth it? yes!!  i have learned some thing in our journey: first, that according to our nutritionist/chiro who treated us, lyme and a parasite go hand in hand. that's one reason it won't leave completely - as the parasite dies, the bacteria is re-released. secondly, the bacteria feeds on sugar! cut the sugar, starve the bacteria. this also includes fruit sugar as well. third, the immune system can be tweaked to fight this bug, but not alone (unless you're super human!) the antibiotics are necessary, at least from what i saw with us. once our systems were functioning well enough, they were able to ""take over"" and get rid of the rest of it.  we may still have it lying dormant somewhere - many say that lyme never really leaves, but we continue to stick to our diets and remain healthy.  i have seen many, many more benefits to the program we have been on including a child who had previously been the king of colds, sinus issues and viruses go through a winter of not one single cold! i have four children and he was the healthiest one all winter, which has never, ever happened before. i really cannot be more pleased with the way our bodies have responded to the supplements and diet.  i don't want to sound like an info-mercial here or some kind of health nut, and i dont' want this to sound like the ""silver bullet"" cure all. my nutritionist said during the first visit ""i cannot cure your lyme. all i can do is to build your system to fight it."" i have nothing to gain by sharing this except that i felt an obligation to do it and share our story. there are answers out there but you must seek them out and the medical community isn't going to help you do it.  if you are in northern nj and are interested in my nutritionist or the doctor who i saw who gave me the antibiotics without a positive blot, i would be glad to share them."^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^1^0^0^0
hi gang i had stopped posting (almost) because i had lost hope of a cure,and coulden't lead people on any more.  then i gave myself 14 months benzathine penicilan shots.for my weight 2.5 cc twice a week injected in my bottom by my self.  with a egg timer i first stuck my butt muscle,and slowly pressed down the plunger over a 3 minute time.  not fun at all !! sometimes i got a dull needle and the blood ran down my leg .  one time i hit that main nerve that passes across your butt and fell on the floor.while it felt like a thousand worms were under my skull in my brain. syatic nerve.  i would not stop ,but at 14 months i got 3 dull needles in a row and i stopped.  i had had enuf!!!!  and it was enuf no more lyme stuff!!!  aaaaooooo!!!!!!  update the remission lasted 0ne year ,now i am looking for another antibiotic for long term use.  or perhaps 2 years benzathine penn. g  maddog  [ 11-30-2009, 07:54 pm: message edited by: maddog ]^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
hello everyone,  i haven't posted here in a while, and some of you may recall that my daughter, now 19 was finally diagnosed with lyme and babs about a year ago. well, after a 3 month search and totally because of this website, we found a llmd in nj who has (knock wood) worked nothing short of a miracle.  in jnauary, she started college...only 1 semester behind her peers. some of you may recall the battles i had with the high school to allow her to graduate and attend her senior prom. those few shorty months ago, getting out of bed was a major accomplishment for her!!  dear lymenet community,  i want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for all of your support, guidance and invaluable information. most of all, for introducing me to the concept of a llmd ... without which i shudder to think what her life would still be like today.  i love you guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  elle^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"it's time to post my success story:  i'm finally well from lyme for the past three months, and well into recovery from the effects of lyme.  my recovery took nine months. they were some of the hardest months of my whole illness because i forced myself to stay in heavy herx mode most of that time.  i am still continuing to get well after three months without symptoms, and a very high stress load because my daughter was hospitalized for an accident.  i had borrelia, bartonella, babesia, and klebsiella pneumonia.  i have had tick born infections since i was about seven years old. i have to wonder if the case of ""mumps with encephalitis"" i had when i was seven was really from a tick bite.  my next door neighbor had bartonella when i was little. i started having bladder spasms and difficulty communicating verbally, and memory loss at that time.  the big bite happened when i was 22 (over 20 years ago.) two weeks after pulling off several ticks i started having mysterious bladder symptoms, chronic pain, and fatigue. they got worse and worse over the years.  i fought them off with diet, supplements and exercise. symptoms rose and fell over the years with my stress level, causing them to be labeled as psychosomatic.  both pregnancies were nightmare with being unable to sleep, get up, eat, think, etc. my second breast fed child reacted to my high cortisol levels by never sleeping, which kept the levels high until my adrenals crashed entirely. then lyme took over and i was completely unable to function.  my naturopath put me on cortef, which gave me enough ability back to pursue more answers. then he got me a positive lyme test which put me on the road to recovery. for this i will be eternally grateful.  one year later, i have my life back. i think i will be able to get my health back to the point where i will feel energetic again. i'm still fighting off some candida, and may want to test for h. pylori. i'm still stiff, but no more pain. i'd like to drop the spare 15 pounds, but i think that will take care of itself as i continue to heal.  i can think. what's more, i can feel. i am happy. i can experience something other than anguish, misery, dread, terror.  life is good. i am playing with my kids, going skiing, running, socializing, working, etc. my house is clean, and my affairs are mostly in order. i'm even homeschooling my middle schooler, and loving it.  my protocol was based on a combination of ilads, buhner, and dr. k. in wa. i am under-insured, have no area llmd, and was unable to travel. i read two to three hours a day, and put it together myself, with the help of some local practitioners.  if you want to read my regimen and protocol here is the link to the post. http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=062900""""000000  i wish you all the very best in health and in lifelong wellness and vitality. i am grateful to lymenet for the information, support, and encouragement that made my recovery possible. i couldn't have done it without you.  -------------------- bejoy!

"topic: my experience, my opinion roro frequent contributor member """" 13383 posted 04 november, 2007 05:29 pm  i just want to post my experience here, in case it might help others.  i was originally diagnosed with lyme disease in 1995. i had three bite marks on my leg that turned red and expanded. the doctor notes desribed as ""halo""  i did i think 4-8 weeks of doxy, can't remember. thought i was cured. a year later i started getting painful knees.  i was always very active, athletic, did a lot of hiking, camping, rollerblading, dancing, worked out at the gym.  for years i got the runaround, was diagnosed with cfs, depression, treated for hepatitis c. i got worse, but had periods of remission here and there where i felt ok. i now wonder if those were after antibiotics, but i didn't notice back then.  in 1999 i found a doctor who treated me with a lot of alternative therapies. he never told me he suspected lyme, but treated me with what i know now were lyme treatments. iv vitamin c, transfer factor, many other herbal and natural therapies.  when i did question about lyme, he told me i was negative, but i never saw the tests myself. he said antibiotics don't work anyway when you had it as long as me.  i continued to get worse despite all the natural therapies, diet, vitamins, etc. i also started taking cortef for adrenal exhaustion, and started having autonomic dysfunction. never did long term antibiotics.  in 2004 i went into heart failure, got meningitis, cranial nerve palsy and was admitted to the hospital. i have gotten progressively worse for the past 3 years.  i have been suspected of having als, ms, myasthenia and many other things because my symptoms are so severe. i have gotten no answers, no diagnosis, and no treatment from mainstream medicine. i have arthritis in my spine, and damage to several discs and 2 vertebrae.  narcotics kept me functioning at a low level for a couple more years. last year i stopped functioning. this past year or so, i have been very ill.  i have difficulty doing even the simplist things, like bathe, walk, have a bowel movement. i wanted to die this summer. i really was looking into physician assisted suicide. i cried every day.  since august 20th i have been on antibiotic. i have gotten a little bit better. my symptoms are getting better and i have some good days now. i no longer want to die. i no longer cry every day. my pain is better.  i still have some symptoms, and i still have bad days, but i am much better than i was last summer. i may have permanent nerve damage, so i dont know if i will get 100% better.  i wish i had gone to an llmd years ago and tried long term antibiotic. maybe i would have prevented permanent nerve damage.  -------------------- success stories---treatment guidelines"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"my 2nd success story...  after re-infection in may 2007 with babesia, bart again, borrelia (with arthritis again), ehrlichia, rickettsia and mycoplasma (according to my doctor), plus intestinal candida, that i believe came from the tick too(because i never had this problem before, and it went easily after treatment, so it was not chronic).  i fell sick in a matter of hours after infected tick bite, that stayed attached for about 9 hours. every symptom came back, specially babesia symptoms, like a repetition of all i had before (light sensitivity, night sweats etc).  i tuned almost all my treatments with my own muscle tests and then went to my art practioners to get some supportive things for my organs and homeopathics. but my treatment plan was built by myself at home, with chinese herbs and other stuff. it's all here in lymenet.  for babesia, it's under ""babesia alternative treatment"". for bartonella, under ""bartonella alternative herbs"" or so. i took doxy for a few weeks, but it didn't do the whole job (my doctor gave it to me), i even didn't feel any positive effect from it either, but i was in constant herxes/ feeling bad the whole time after bite, so i can't say it helped/ didn't help for sure. doxy tested good with art, so i took it for 2 weeks.  borrelia: the best thing for me are always buhner's herbs in all possible combinations , tuned by muscle tests (amount).  bart, babesia: i wrote here what worked for me (in medical). most important: cleansing with chlrorella, msm, whatever helped (chitosan, zeolites..., rubbing farah's oils or other oils). herxes are awful.  the other treatments, all with herbs too, it worked if i tuned with my muscle tests. eventually, i got symptomless by the end of october 07.  funny that i thought i was attacking acute bart and borrelia and all the other stuff, but in the end, got rid of my chronic bartonella and chronic borrelia altogether!!  got a small relapse sometime in november/ beginning of december after sleeping little for a month. then after a few days of buhn'ers herbs and other stuff, got rid again of the em rash that reappeared on my chest.  i'm still fighting fungal infection in my skin, pre-lyme, but it's getting better (but it's so slow...). it's not too bad, but still not 100% gone as i wished.  i'm back to consuming wine socially, full of energy if i'm not herxing from fungi, back to life really, in all senses. my brain got no bad scars, i think. no lyme scar whatsoever (except for having lost two teeth). i'm not in a diet, but eat almost 100% healthy when i can.  i don't consider myself healthy, though, as i'm pretty sure if i get bitten again, i'll fall sick and will need lots of help to get out of trouble. but so far, i'm again symptomless since about december 2007. if i were really healthy, i wouldn't fall so sick so fast like all my neighbors here that get constantly bitten by ticks.  i'm on astragalus, cats claw, sometimes i add other stuff; like now i'm on stephania, just in case. i never stop propolis, cod liver oil, chlrorella, i'm still on cardamon for cleaning fungal toxins, and eventually, milk thistle, or magnesium, or calcium, or trace minerals, depending on what tests good. but that's all.  my little daughter continues totally symptomless, she's learning her 4th language now by the age of 4 (so definitively no brain damage from lyme), very active and healthy. she's also on forever chlorella, cgf, flaxseed oil and propolis or bee products when they test.  last year, the best tick protection stuff for us were homeopathic borrelia nosodes lm4, we took a bit of it every week and didn't get bitten by infetected ticks again. hopefully they'll still work this year and we won't fall sick again, me and my daughter. my husband is a tick repellent himself, never got bitten no matter what he does outdoors.  so my treatment was a combo of homeopathics, herbs, kmt, buhner's herbs, chinese herbs, lots of cleansing, phsycho kinesiology (that unblocked some stuff i would never believe it would), that's all, i think.  i also did lots of dental treatments, pulled out teeth that were testing bad in art (ancient root canals), now i have golden partial protesis in the place of these teeth, i took amalgams off and did chelation for more than a year (soon, it'll be two years of metal detoxing). i'm fully convinced metals played a role on my body being weakened. as for my canal teeth pulled out, i was happy at least for one, as it was causing me dull pain for about a decade. now pain is zero.  best tools for me: own muscle tests (i also posted about it here in lymenet) and art (muscle tests done by my practioners).  wishing you all good luck in finding treatments. each person is so different, so anything that works is great if it makes you feel better! selma  [ 29. january 2008, 11:22 am: message edited by: hardynaka ]"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^1^0^0^0
"i just joined and am finding my way on the computer. hope this is the way to reply?  i feel that i am a success in process. i've had lymes for almost 20 years with the last 10 getting progressively worse until i was unable to get out of bed many days and was too depressed when i did get up to do much but a meal or two each day.  i had done all kinds of alternatives; herbs, acuputure, multiple therapies, the drugs, silver ivs, most of the stuff in rosner's book and had no herxs at all, except one minor ache for 30 minutes my first time on the ac rife machine. nothing after that. so was very depressed and hopeless since i wasn't even herxing, how could i get better?  then i heard of ""john of god"", a powerful healer in brazil. the first couple of times i heard about him i let it go. the third time i knew to pay attention. fortunately my mom financed the trip as i have only ssi and disability for income. i know i am very fortunate to have her help. it was a horrible trip, 30 or more hours flying and in airports where people spoke brazilian portugese, which i don't. but i finally made it there and joined my group and leader (who knows the protocol and language).  i wasn't aware of much happening or improvement there or when i came home so thought nothing much happened. however i did finally have a herx, and what a whopper! two days of intense pain everywhere (except my tongue). i moaned and rolled and cried continually pretty much. i'd never felt such intense pain all over my body. funny i should think nothing much happened, huh?  about 6-7 months after this i am now working with a medical intuitive who says all the lymes beasties are dead. yes they are still in my body and yes they dumped alot of toxins when they died and that's still effecting me; and most importantly they tore up lots of organs and created considerable damage that will take quite some time to heal (which is why i didn't feel any better and thought nothing had happened). but,they are all dead! this gives me so much hope and thankfulness. i do consider that she may not have seen them all, so i still treat with the rife machines (ac and dc).  however my focus has changed from ""can anything help?"" to ""how can i most effectively heal now?"" and that's such a blessing i can't describe how big.  i am doing herbs to detox, xango juice (which gave me more energy immediately...i actually woke up in the mornings sometimes!) also i've started a program of treatment on the bemer mat that seems to help my nervous system relax so i start smiling about life every time i lay down on the mat. i am so grateful to be healing and on the way up finally after 20 years of going downhill. i now see a future for myself rather than just struggling to make it through until the next day of struggle.  i'm happy to share details with anyone who is interested.  may we all breathe be filled with light and move forward one step at a time.  blessings, healing"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0

(my height is 5'5) so.. one day while i was trying to live a normal life, i was at work and i almost fainted. i left work early.. called my mom up and said that if she didn't bring me to an emergency room outside of our area...(being that the local one thought i was crazy too since i visited the e.r. a couple times a week because i thought i was dying) i would commit suicide because i couldn't live like i was living anymore.. being so sick and not having a diagnosis.  so my mother brought me to a hospital an hour away, a very good hospital at that. the e.r. doctor did not like the way i looked.. he ran blood tests on me.. and like every other doctor he thought it was an over active thyroid, so he tested that. i had told him that i came up positive for lyme disease and he tested me.. since my blood work was normal he sent me home with antibiotics and told me that the lyme disease test results wouldn't be back for a couple of days and that they'd call me if i was positive.  well.. i got that call.. i was so happy, i started crying on the phone with the doctor and thanked him and said ""i knew i wasn't crazy all along"" so my mother and i then searched for a lyme disease specialist.. i found one about an hour away from me. i got a picc line and began my treatment on rocephin and oral zithromax.. i was treated for 90 days on that. i was ok for a couple of months and then i relapsed.. the doctor then put me onto the picc again and i was treated with iv vancomycin and rocephin at the same time...that treatment lasted 60 days.  since then i have been in remission. if it wasn't for that lyme disease specialist i probably would not be alive today. while i was sick i never saw the light at the end of the tunnel.. i thought i'd never get better.. but i did.  i still have some symptoms of lyme disease as in cfs (chronic fatigue syndrome) i still have difficulty with my memory but not as bad, and math with number reversal and anxiety still but i take medication for the anxiety. i do have a very very low immune system but thats a small price to pay for all that i went through.. i'd rather get colds more often then others rather then be sick with lyme disease.  i am working a full time job now, i am getting my life back in order. i plan to go to college soon.. since i had to drop out while i was sick. there is hope.. i never thought i'd pull through it and i did. i always keep the thought of relapsing in the back of my mind but i know theres nothing i can do about it if i do relapse and i know who to go to. i get tested for lyme every now and then just to make sure im still showing up negative.  i just felt the need to give all of you that are suffering some hope.. i hope i helped someone see that there is a light at the end of that very dark tunnel. i will continue to post on here from now on because i know that when i was sick i never saw anyone in here who had been a success story.. only war stories.. no offence guys but i know that a lot of people who are in remission do not come to help those that are still suffering. so i will be talking with you guys soon.  <3 koryn  -------------------- ~*in remission for 3 years!! there is a light at the end of the tunnel, just keep holding on!*~ koryn posts: 8 | from: poke-a-nose, pa | registered: nov 2007 | ip: logged  -------------------- ""beep beep"""^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
i think for my 36th birthday (ok, yesterday) it's time to add myself to success stories as symptom-free. i did it by starting with a few months of antibiotics and then moved on to a year of buhner protocol herbs, and seem to be a 'textbook case' of what the buhner protocol is supposed to do. other people have had less success with it than i have, so don't assume it's a miracle cure for everyone.  i posted here- it was a poll about herbal treatment users: http://flash.lymenet.org/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=060406;p=1  and here's what i said about my treatment:^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"californialyme frequent contributor member """" 7136 posted 06 november, 2007 08:56 am  annie leach & her dog, wolfgang amadeus mozart from old lyme alliance story archive ************************************************* annie and wolfgang amadeus mozart  1992 muskegon chronicle.  several years ago, someone shared this story of annie and her dog wolfie's bout with lyme disease with us. we often thought about their story, and wanted to share it with you. this story is presented with annie's (and wolfie's!) permission, along with an update that annie thoughtfully gave us on their progress since 1992. ******************************* annie leach and her dog, wolfgang amadeus mozart, have a special relationship. they became severely disabled with what was eventually diagnosed as lyme disease. they suffered for a long time before their conditions were identified and treated. they made good recoveries.  leach, 37, of muskegon is an art teacher at michigan dunes montessori in norton shores. she was stricken a year ago by a puzzling, debilitating condition. she wondered if she would be able to continue working. unable to drive, unable to walk without assistance, suffering excruciating joint pain and headaches, the vision in her left eye impaired, leach was at the end of her rope.  she had been battling an unidentified, worsening illness for more than a year. a host of doctors had tested and treated her for mononucleosis, strep throat, muscle-attacking viruses, migraine head-aches, sinus problems, mold allergies, infectious bronchitis, lupus, a nose polyp, thyroid disease and stress. her medicine cabinet was over-flowing, but she wasn't getting better.  when a physician suggested that she take tranquilizers, leach remembers thinking that she might be losing her mind. ""i was really scared. i was getting this big psychological thing. i thought maybe i was just grasping at straws.""  while leach battled her illness her dog, a jack russell terrier, had been showing some of the same symptoms: listlessness, neck stiffness, lack of appetite. in late summer of 1991, a newaygo veterinarian decided to treat the animal for lyme disease, even though blood tests had not confirmed the lyme bacterium's presence. ""in a way."" leach recalled. ''the dog's problem helped me think about my situation. our problems were very similar.""  leach's dog was named after mozart because of his habit of hiding behind the piano when he wasn't feeling well. however, after several weeks of veterinary-prescribed antibiotics, ""wolfie"" came out of his hiding place and began to behave in his usual playful manner. inspired by her dog's recovery, leach demanded a lyme test for herself. to her disappointment, the test was negative. desperate for a treatment, leach turned to a medical practice in saginaw she had heard about where patients suffering the symptoms of lyme disease are often treated in the absence of blood-test confirmation.  by the time she visited one of the doctors at the saginaw clinic in october, she had reached the weakened stage where ""all i could do is stand in a doctor's office and cry. someone had to hold onto me."" the physicians ""listened to me,"" leach said. ""they didn't try to pass it off and just prescribe medicine. they were really nice."" a new series of blood tests and physical examinations, including magnetic resonance imaging, hinted that she might have lyme disease, but the tests didn't confirm its presence. undeterred, her physicians prescribed a series of drugs that began to reverse her illness. ""it happened in stages,"" leach said. ""at first i got sicker, but then i started feeling better. i still wasn't feeling well, but i could see an improvement.""  in january, leach resumed driving, and she began having more and more ""good days."" she continued teaching and credits family and friends with helping her to continue her life. ""they saved me from psychiatric treatment: the doctors (at first) kept saying i didn't have (lyme disease),"" she said. leach still takes medicine to combat her symptoms, and visits the saginaw clinic once a month. when she has had two consecutive symptom-free months, her medication will be reduced or discontinued.  lyme disease has been in the medical literature since the 19th century. it is transmitted most often by the bacterial organism borrelia burgdorferi in the body of a comma-size tick called ixodes dammini. the tick, most often found in wisconsin, minnesota and eastern coastal states, lives on animal hosts, particularly the white-footed field mouse and deer. it is often called the ""deer"" tick.   update from annie: in the summer of 1992, when the article appeared about wolfgang and myself, i thought i was not only on the road to recovery, i thought i was there. i did not know what i was in for. i had been on suprax since october of 1991, and could drive myself to work. during this time, i continued to teach part time. my students were very supportive, helping set up chairs and art supplies for me. it was a wonderful lesson for them in listening and learning from verbal instruction. my dog wolfie often accompanied me to school and slept in the corner. during the summer i rested and slept a lot. along with the antibiotics i took twenty-five acidopholus a day, and lots of vitamins.  in september after returning to work my symptoms worsened. i was put on biaxin; that seemed to help. my condition was like a seesaw. i would feel great and then the symptoms would flare up. basically, i worked and slept. during this time, jeff, a cna, moved into our home. in exchange for room and board, he took care of feeding me and caring for me. this was a great blessing. (if you live near a college, it might be an option for you, too.) wolfie continued to receive cortisone shots. i went to a chiropractor. as many of you know, with lyme disease, combining traditional and alternative medicines is a path to take - if you can find the right doctor!  relying on my husband, george, as well as jeff and some friends, i made it through the school year, but it was obvious my symptoms were worsening. it was decided that i would go on iv antibiotics as soon as school let out in june. i figured that this would give me summer to kick this thing! wrong!!! in the fall, i went back to school with the iv still in. in the late fall, my dosage was doubled to twice a day. i began to gain back my strength, and on december 31 had the iv removed. during this time, dr. natole was a lifesaver. somehow, he knows every little change in a patient's condition. it must be from treating so many people successfully.  after going off the iv, i was put back on oral antibiotics, and i continued to improve. this was not the dramatic improvement that occurred after treatment first started. it was very gradual, and many changes were so slight that no one could tell but me. at this time we had wolfgang vaccinated, and he continued to improve. i continued on my regime of acidophilus, vitamins and rest. over the next year-and-a-half, my progress was slow but improving.  in october of 1995, after six weeks of no symptoms i was taken off the antibiotics. in preparation for this i had researched, and found a doctor that believed in lyme who would take me on as a patient, and who practiced homeopathic medicine along with traditional. along with the acidophilus, i was given drops to take to cleanse my system of parasites. my goal was to stay off the antibiotics. best of all, dr. ruth treats me as i know what i am talking about, and lets me make decisions.  since october of 1995, i have been back to my stubborn irish self. i'm back to work, and have even started working in an art gallery. working around children and being exposed to many illnesses, i did not get sick. in the past several weeks, i went on antibiotics for a severe ear infection. i became extremely sick, so i went off them. that was about two weeks ago, and i am feeling better now. i believe that the bacteria are still in my system. for now though, i am blessed to be able to live, and do more than i thought i would ever be able to do. wolfie receives his lyme vaccine once a year, and we have found a vet that is just superb. there is hope - just take one day at a time.  -------------------- success stories---treatment guidelines"^0^1^1^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"i just realized i should add someone to the success list and that is kelly b!! and her daughter. kelly was bit on the head and was then sick for 9 years after tick bite. she was really sick and was on tons of pain meds. she went on iv rocephin and after 2 years she was in full remission. her daughter had been born with lyme and babs and she got well after a much shorter time of treatment. they have both been in full remission for over 5 years now and lead a busy, active life, travel a lot!!!!!!!!!!  there is also rick r who was in treatment for about a year and a half and is in full remission and jogs miles a day.  and the majority of the people are like me, they are 99.9% and stay on abx, but decline if they go off. that seems to be common with santa cruz lyme! but we have a bunch of people who have returned to work after disability and lead normal lives- like patti and lori and kari!!!!!!!!!!!  it is a blesisng to watch people get better- as long as they stick with antibiotics and don't go chasing fad after fad they do get better every time. every single person who has come to our local group has gotten better if not 100% with longterm abx- the only one who didn't was this one guy who killed himself but he had not been in treatment very long and had given up hope because he was so bad-  what is really nice is when someone comes in with a cane or wheelchair- so far every person has lost those devices with treatment!!!!!!!! it is nice to watch someone stride vigorously who came in like that!!!! and we group members see the progress long before they do-  ""hey x you're finishing a whole sentence!!!""  and every one of us who has improved to the point of being able to live life with enjoyment again is a success story in my book*)!!!  -------------------- there is no wealth but life. -john ruskin  all truth goes through 3 stages: first it is ridiculed: then it is violently opposed: finally it is accepted as self evident. - schopenhauer"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0

i think it's time to add my story to this thread.  i've actually had to cobble together my lyme history, based on journal entries. i had symptoms dating back to the early 1990s. then in 1996, i had a tick bite and rash. at that time, i was treated with abx for about 18 days. the rash went away, and i figured i was fine.  over the next few years, i had a variety of weird symptoms, which sent me from one medical specialist to another--about 16 in all. each one seemed convinced of what was wrong with me, with dx ranging from endometrial cancer to tendonitis to hypothyroidism. i spent a lot of money on treatments they suggested, and my health continued to worsen.  by 2002, i was exhausted all the time and only working part time. my memory was slipping, it was difficult for me to concentrate or think. i was walking with a limp and still going from doctor to doctor. i was also beating up on myself a lot, because i didn't know what was going on...so i kept trying to push myself.  finally, in 2005, an acupucturist i was seeing suggested lyme disease as a strong possibility.  i went online, found this site and started reading about all the controversy surrounding the disease.  i spent a long long time trying to figure out which llmd to see and finally decided on someone out of state. i think that's one of the best decisions i made.  i started antibiotic treatment for lyme and bart in june, 2005.  initially, i got much much worse and had new, scary symptoms which included seizures, full body paralysis (which lasted more than 3 hours), chills that nothing could slake, even worse exhaustion and a slew of bizarre cognitive problems. i literally found it impossible to remember anything from one minute to the next.  i held on to a thread of work, just to stay busy, and i refused to go to bed for more than a day here and there. i kept holding out hope that i would beat this. i prayed a lot and struggled against awful depression.  i augmented my antibiotic treatment with herbs, supplements and some alternative things. i was fortunate enough to have weekly acupuncture, which i think helped me a lot, as did chinese herbs my acupuncturist gave me. but i never stopped taking antibiotics.  it took about 9 months before i noticed discernible improvement. at that point, my llmd started me on tindimax, to address the cystic form of the disease. it was a rough antibiotic, but i began to notice even more improvement.  after being in treatment for about 14 months, i was able to walk more than a few blocks. i pushed myself to walk until i was up to a mile. sometimes, though, my foot would just go numb or i'd develop searing pain in my hip. those had been very early symptoms, and i never knew when they would happen again.  around 14 months, i was hired to do some consulting work for a national company. after a few contract months, they asked me to come on full time. i talked with my llmd, my acupuncturist, my so (who's been a rock through all this hell). the health insurance alone made the whole thing too tempting to refuse. prior to this, i'd been paying bcbs out of pocket, which was a fortune!  i started working in january, 2007 and have been there ever since. although i told my bosses about my condition prior to them hiring me, i doubt my co-workers have any idea i've been sick.  i'm still on abx but am weaning them down. i now walk regularly--one to two miles at a time three or four days a week-- and only occasionally have the numbness return. my thinking has vastly improved, the stuttering i had is gone. i no longer have the sensory distortion i did. my social life is back.  this past summer, we vacationed in canada, and i drove the whole 9 hours to get there with no problems.  i have a good friend who's a nurse and saw me at my very worst. she told me just recently that she never imagined i would ever survive this. i was drooling and seizing and shaking with chills.  i'm definitely not there anymore.  i feel incredibly grateful to have so much of my life back, and i hope anyone who reads this feels the hope it holds.  andie^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"historical mileposts...for those feeling like they are on the wrong boat  lishs mom posted 31 january 2004 21:19  i was reflecting today on our journey with lyme disease. reflecting on the pain, the fear, the doubt....  ....the ups, the downs, the sideways...and then the joys...  its been a very long journey, some of you know us well, others are new here. when we started our journey it was full of hope, and we felt refreshed. somewhere along the way, we found that many of those we spoke with three years ago, have gone on. either became frustrated and quit, or became well and dont visit the board too often.  those who became well, we quickly have forgotten about, and the board is filled with others who are too, just beginning the journey.  those who became frustrated, began jumping from treatment to treatment in hopes of finding a cure. in hopes of living their dreams of a fullfilled life, free of pain, free of random thoughts on top of random thoughts that come so fast you forget the ""main thought"" which was not random at all...  while our journey is still in progress, i have been in prayer regarding sharing, being careful not to take the credit our selves, but to thank god every day for the special people who have interceded in our daily life, to make it a bit better for us.  dr. jones, sabra and his full staff. some are no longer there, but we love them all. tincup, lda, and so many more. ultimately god brought them in to our lives, and have helped heal us.  today, i think back when we first got bit...and got sick. my gut said lyme. my docter said no.  8 years later after almost loosing our 12 yr old daughter to congestive heart failure due to her arrhithmya from lyme disease, watching her hobble like an old lady, and crying her to sleep at night, holding her up in the day to do basic tasks like eating, and wondering if she would live another year (according to her neurologist and cardiologist she would not!) and not even knowing if i should pray for life, death or healing (we had prayed for healing for so long we began to think it was not gods will) for my daughter....we found she had lyme, erlichia and babesia.  our daughter had brief periods of remission during her 8 year ordeal, which brought hope. it also brought frustration, because they would be followed by bouts of health much worse that what we had already experienced.  after tincup so lovingly referred us...(yes, with a rolling pin in her hand ready to pop me over the head if i said no!).... to dr. jones, we knew that life would be much better.  to our surprise, we were terribly terribly wrong. our daughter began treatment, and she became unable to be on her feet very long. her pain now was about 30 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst. the next 12 months of our lives were spent with her in bed nearly 22 hours a day. she cried at night...she cried at day and she tore our hearts apart. so many times i wanted to stop treatment...so many times she begged to stop treatment. but we all would remember the path we had been on.  we began to justify that path wasnt so bad...was it??? not nearly this bad...  but 8 months in, we literally woke up one day with a daughter who was like all the other teens. it lasted a short while, and she drifted back into her body riddle with pain. but this brief glimpse, was enough to carry us on with more demand for a healthy life.  i researched more, we spend thousands of dollars to see the best...and dr. jones patiently waited. documenting small positive changes that were difficult for us to realize..  the many trips to the er, became one long fuzzy year...and i began to doubt again. was this ever going to end? was this a big lie? should we quit antibiotics?  i went to our internal med doc, and asked her to do a full body scan. i knew my daughter must have cancer. leukemia had been a possibility before her lyme diagnosis. please check her again. i know we are dealing with something else. the gracious doctor did every test she could. she began implementing new pain therapies. but she told us, that she had seen improvement, even if we didnt.  she had faith in dr. jones, and gods answers through doctor jones, for healing for our daughter.  she kept us on track with the therapy, herself curious to see if ""this would really work"".  our final ""tempation"" to stop all therapy came with the most severe, debilitating headache one could imagine. our daughter would writhe in pain, after 100 mg of iv demerol, her body would continue to spasm from the severe pain in the spine and head. for nearly 6 weeks, we made the local er our every other night travel.  then...one day our daughter woke up without a headache, and the pain was tolerable, and her body started to show significant healing.  she began physical therapy two weeks later, and has continued building her tissues that connect muscles and bones. her pain is under control.  yes she still gets tired, ....but wouldnt you after rock climbing 15 hours a week, e skating once or twice and week, and doing your school work? oh yeah, she is retaining her school work too!  our road to recovery is still in progress. we attribute the excellent recovery so far to answers from prayer from many of you and us on behalf of our daughter, excellent doctors who really care,good diets, and a young lady who never gave up or jumped from protocol to protocol, but followed the llmds advice, even when it seemed the rock wall we were climbing was too tall with too few holds.   i know this is long, but i really wanted to share, to give hope, and to help those debating if they should continue or stop treatment, to choose the advice of their llmd. i hope and pray for all of you on this board, that you will continue to heal.  love, theresa  -------------------- success stories---treatment guidelines"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"frequent contributor member """" 4622  icon 7 posted 11 august, 2004 01:55 pm profile for lymeinhell  hi there!  i don't know where the link is either, but perhaps my story will give you some hope...  9 years ago i came down with a mystery ailment... bone crushing tiredness, dizziness, chronic runs, hair falling out, sleep problems.... i thought i was dying.  i went from dr. to dr. and the diagnosis they gave me - epstein barr virus - that i had mono, that i would by symptomatic for a long time. that i would tire easily for the rest of my life. 2 years later, i felt better, but indeed always tired very easily, had tempter tantrums, and tinnitus. i was very prone to sinus infections, and would get u.t.i.'s every 6 months like clockwork.  fast forward 8 years later, to last july. lots of stress going on in my life, some kinda teeny lump on the inside of my ear that hurt like hell, then found the teeniest tick i ever saw in my bed.  followed by vertigo, fever, sinus infection, runs, and neck pain. diagnosis - sinus infection (yeah right). 4 weeks later a big circle appeared on my arm. then the muscle spazms in my neck and head kicked in, followed by migraines, panic attacks, brain fog, then sciatic pain, leg swelling, heart palpitations, eye swelling (i looked like i had been punched in the eye)...  8 months and 12 specialists later, i finally went to an llmd in march. she started treatment immediately for lyme and bartonella. she also suspected i had parasites, as i had by this time lost 50 lbs. she also said my 'epstein barr' incident was probably my first infection with lyme.  so here i am now almost 5 months into treatment. i sleep through the night (although i still take flexeril at bedtime) , have almost no muscular pain, the floaters and spots are almost gone, my blood pressure hasn't been this good in  years, my head is clear, my stomach is great and my sinuses are great (and i have a bigtime mold allergy according to allergist). we're still working on the  tinnitus/dizziness - i hope the damage isn't permanent. i go to work every day, i can go out to dinner and big open spaces don't freak me out anymore. my llmd has weaned me down to half doses on my antibiotics. i think a lot of my remaining issues are yeast and heavy metals related.  am i cured? no. but am i better - wayyyyy better (80%). in 5 months, that's terrific considering how long i went untreated. did i ever think i would even make it this far?? not on your life.  i have tried a few things to help heal myself that others may or may not think conventional, but i know they really helped me. your email is not listed, but mine is, so please feel free to email me privately.  i hope in some little way my story has helped you feel that there is a little light at the end of the tunnel. because, really, this too shall pass...  healthy thoughts to you.  ------------------ julie g. __________________________________________________ ************************************************** update::  posted 12 november, 2007 06:08 pm lymeinhell been so busy i forgot to celebrate the day - nov. 10th was my 3 year anniversary off antibiotics!! [woohoo]  i continue to eat right, get my sleep, exercise and detox.  when i look back to a year ago, i say i'm a little more 'normal' and really don't have any lyme moments. i even survived a cold without any lyme symptoms kicking up.  i still take toa free cat's claw, flexeril, a beta blocker to keep my pulse in the normal zone(2 tries to get me off have not gone well), and periodic treatment with diflucan. i continue on my vitamin regimen and theralac and biweekly im shots of magnesium. i use the podi patches about 5 days each month.  just wanted others to know that it can be done - people do get well and even stick around here (just maybe don't stick our 2 cents in often enough).  wishing the same good health to all. [big grin]  here's the link to my past celebrations: http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=049168  ok, so maybe this should be in general...  but it's 2 years without antibiotics for me today!!!! and i feel fantastic - better than ever!  i still take toa free cat's claw for maintenance, tons of vitamins and minerals, theralac (a miracle worker) and flexeril at bedtime. wish i could get off of it but still not able to.  i continue to give myself im magnesium shots, although weaning down to every 10 days now (from weekly). my magnesium levels are in the lower end of normal range (from scary low levels). recent hormone testing has shown significant increase in my progesterone levels, so i guess the balancing act is beginning to work.  i use the podi patches one week a month, although not much comes out of them any more and they're very light in color - another good sign..  haven't had my cd57 rechecked because.... well because the last test a year ago got me very bummed despite my good health (i was a 1/19 absolute)..  not bragging here - just looking to share some good news and let the newer people know there is light at the end of the tunnel.  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=038928  -------------------- julie g. _ _ ___ _ _ lymeinhell  blessed are those who expect nothing, for they shall not be disappointed.

"the below is not a lyme story, but an inspirational one i got on the email that is true! the photos will not show up, but his personal story is below.  we all complain about this and that, how would you like to ""walk"" in his shoes born with no arms/hands nor any legs/feet!  now we each can count our blessings for what we do have left that works! i do anyway! thank you god!  *********************   this young man is truly god's blessing! when we think we have got it bad or life has treated us so unfairly (""why me"")...  i hope oprah does get him on her show...he could then touch millions of lives ***************************  my name is nick vujicic and i give god the glory for how he has used my testimony to touch thousands of hearts around the world!  i was born without limbs and doctors have no medical explanation for this birth ""defect"". as you can imagine, i was faced with many challenges and obstacles.   ""consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds.""   ...to count our hurt, pain and struggle as nothing but pure joy? as my parents were christians, and my dad even a pastor of our church, they knew that verse very well. however, on the morning of the 4th of december 1982 in melbourne ( australia ), the last two words on the minds of my parents was ""praise god!"".  their firstborn son had been born without limbs! there were no warnings or time to prepare themselves for it. the doctors we shocked and had no answers at all! there is still no medical reason why this had happened and nick now has a brother and sister who were born just like any other baby.   the whole church mourned over my birth and my parents were absolutely devastated. everyone asked, ""if god is a god of love, then why would god let something this bad happen to not just anyone, but dedicated christians?""  my dad thought i wouldn't survive for very long, but tests proved that i was a healthy baby boy just with a few limbs missing.   understandably, my parents had strong concern and evident fears of what kind of life i'd be able to lead. god provided them strength, wisdom and courage through those early years and soon after that i was old enough to go to school.   the law in australia didn't allow me to be integrated into a main-stream school because of my physical disability.  god did miracles and gave my mom the strength to fight for the law to be changed.  i was one of the first disabled students to be integrated into a main-stream school.  i liked going to school, and just try to live life like everyone else, but it was in my early years of school where i encountered uncomfortable times of feeling rejected, weird and bullied because of my physical difference.   it was very hard for me to get used to, but with the support of my parents, i started to develop attitudes and values which helped me overcome these challenging times.  i knew that i was different but on the inside i was just like everyone else. there were many times when i felt so low that i wouldn't go to school just so i didn't have to face all the negative attention.  i was encouraged by my parents to ignore them and to try start making friends by just talking with some kids.  soon the students realized that i was just like them, and starting there god kept on blessing me with new friends.  there were times when i felt depressed and angry because i couldn't change the way i was, or blame anyone for that matter.  i went to sunday school and learnt that god loves us all and that he cares for you. i understood that love to a point as a child, but i didn't understand that if god loved me why did he make me like this? is it because i did something wrong?  i thought i must have because out of all the kids at school, i'm the only weird one. i felt like i was a burden to those around me and the sooner i go, the better it'd be for everyone. i wanted to end my pain and end my life at a young age, but i am thankful once again, for my parents and family who were always there to comfort me and give me strength.  due to my emotional struggles i had experienced with bullying, self esteem and loneliness, god has implanted a passion of sharing my story and experiences to help others cope with whatever challenge they have in their life and let god turn it into a blessing.  to encourage and inspire others to live to their fullest potential and not let anything get in the way of accomplishing their hopes and dreams.  one of the first lessons that i have learnt was not to take things for granted .   ""and we know that in all things god works for the best for those who love him.""  that verse spoke to my heart and convicted me to the point where that i know that there is no such thing as luck, chance or coincidence that these ""bad"" things happen in our life.   i had complete peace knowing that god won't let anything happen to us in our life unless he has a good purpose for it all.  i completely gave my life to christ at the age of fifteen after reading john 9.  jesus said that the reason the man was born blind was ""so that the works of god may be revealed through him. ""  i truly believed that god would heal me so i could be a great testimony of his awesome power.  later on i was given the wisdom to understand that if we pray for something, if it's god's will, it'll happen in his time. if it's not god's will for it to happen, then i know that he has something better. i now see that glory revealed as he is using me just the way i am and in ways others can't be used.   i am now 23 years old and have completed a bachelor of commerce majoring in financial planning and accounting.  i am also a motivational speaker and love to go out and share my story and testimony wherever opportunities become available.  i have developed talks to relate to and encourage students through topics that challenge today's teenagers. i am also a speaker in the corporate sector.  i have a passion for reaching out to youth and keep myself available for whatever god wants me to do, and wherever he leads, i follow.  i have many dreams and goals that i have set to achieve in my life.  i want to become the best witness i can be of god's love and hope, to become an international inspirational speaker and be used as a vessel in both christian and non-christian venues.  i want to become financially independent by the age of 25, through real estate investments, to modify a car for me to drive and to be interviewed and share my story on the "" oprah winfrey show ""!  writing several best-selling books has been one of my dreams and i hope to finish writing my first by the end of the year.  it will be called ""no arms, no legs, no worries !""   i believe that if you have the desire and passion to do something, and if it's god's will, you will achieve it in good time.  as humans, we continually put limits on ourselves for no reason at all! what's worse is putting limits on god who can do all things.  we put god in a ""box"". the awesome thing about the power of god, is that if we want to do something for god, instead of focusing on our capability, concentrate on our availability for we know that it is god through us and we can't do anything without him. once we make ourselves available for god's work, guess whose capabilities we rely on? god's !  may the lord bless you in christ, nick vujicic  from bettyg; i hope this touched you as much as it did me! i've walked away a better person for having read and posted this here for us all as a success story of many adveristies!!"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0

"kari mayne  i contracted lyme in february of 1988 - thirteen years ago. i was not diagnosed with lyme until august 1999, after being sick for 11 years (and having a stillborn child - lyme of course.) before i was finally diagnosed with lyme i exhibited all the classic als symptoms, and had lost an uncle to als. thus - the doctors thought they had an als diagnosis nailed down tight. only through my stubborness and refusal to accept the als dx did i research the internet and find an llmd. my first visit, even without labs, the doc - god bless him - said i had the worst case of lyme he had ever seen at that time. subsequent lab tests elisa and western blot both positive.   the symptoms which are now completely gone are: no more severe muscle cramps no more fasciculations no more numbness in face/tongue/forehead i can swallow without difficulty now no more slurring of speech no more limping and severe weakness in legs no more ringing of ears no more confusion/memory loss/lyme fog/depression no more debilitating fatigue i can now pick up pennies off the floor - fine motor skills are back in hands i can lift my eyebrows now i don't choke on liquids bright light doesn't hurt my eyes anymore reynaud's syndrome is better no more intense heel/bottom of foot pain no more tmj or tooth pain no more running into walls, doors because of poor balance or legs ""giving out from under me"" i can drive without getting lost no more hallucinations i can count to 10 i can raise my arms to shampoo my hair no more pain in joints or numbness in limbs   of course, there's more symptoms...but you all know what they are. these were just the ones that plagued me most. everyone, of course, responds differently to medication and recovers at different rates. but, i have no doubt that all of you will get better over time. probably the thing that helped me most is the bicillin shots. behaviorally, plenty of rest and the determination that i would not identify myself as a ""sick"" person kept my attitude positive and my spirits up even when my body argued the opposite. i have lyme, lyme doesn't have me kind of thinking.   i see a great spirit of helpfullness and positive thinking in these emails which makes me want to respond. in various lyme chats and online discussion i have sometimes encountered ""poor me"" kinds of attitudes. not in this newsletter - renee and sean you're awesome! i haven't really participated in any support groups or discussions such as this in a while. since i've gotten better, i don't like to be reminded of my lyme nightmare (even though i am still taking bicillin shots twice weekly.) but you people are so sharp and caring i felt i needed to tell you a good news story. bicillin shots have almost cured me. been taking them a year now...99% of my symptoms are gone. lyme can be defeated! i started seeing improvement (dramatic) in a couple of months after i started with the bicillin shots. my doctor was amazed. it's wierd, you sometimes don't notice that you're getting better because there are so many, many things that are hurting or not working right. then, it will just come to you ""oh, i didn't slur my s's today"" or ""my left hand doesn't feel as stiff and numb as it did."" or ""the sun didn't hurt my eyes today."" sometimes it takes awhile to notice because to you the changes seem small, but they all add up. the biggies for mike - like getting out of bed unassisted - take longer because there are more muscles/nerves/joints/etc. involved in doing them. each muscle/nerve/joint has to heal (and there are many, many of them) before the motion gets easier. that's a lot of healing. that's why you'll see the small changes first - such as ears stop ringing. not as much is involved. my response is that mike is probably improving dramatically, but it may not be in the areas that worry him most.   regarding the bicillin shots. yes, you will find hard lumps at the injection site. there's no way to avoid it. they will eventually get smaller - but not go away. you see, it's scar tissue under there. every time you get a shot, it damages the tissue. these shots are powerful. you will experience times where it's very difficult to insert the needle because you'll run into a lump of scar tissue built up from continuous injections. it really hurts when this happens. yes, sometimes i have bicillin leaking back out of the injection site. it doesn't worry me. it's usually because i got active too fast before my body absorbed the bicillin. just slap a bandaid on their and wait a couple of minutes before attempting to move.   i sympathize with dilemma re: childcare when you can't get out of bed. my doc told me to put my 2 1/2 year old into daycare last may. this month - we took him out because i am well!  -------------------- there is no wealth but life. -john ruskin  all truth goes through 3 stages: first it is ridiculed: then it is violently opposed: finally it is accepted as self evident. - schopenhauer"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
i got lyme in june 2005. em rash two weeks later, 2 weeks 100mg doxy/ day, rash gone.  by october 05, i was so sick, with neuro and arthric symptoms. i found lymenet then and my story is all here.  i got night sweats, light sensitivity, total exhaustion, hard neck, night terrors, tinnitus, heart problems, air hunger (extreme sometimes), pains on all big articulations (including vertebral column), pain on my liver, diarrhea, extreme chills, high temperature 'attacks' (when i had to lay down), scalp swelling, stabbing pains on the head, total brain fog etc etc.  i found no doctor to treat me initially. i took 10 days of amoxy 1,500mg day and most of my symptoms disappeared sometime in october 05. just to return a few days later.  i live in switzerland. the so-called lyme specialist from zurich did nothing to me, despite 3 positive western blots.  in december 05, i begged the 'family' doctor for riamet (anti malarial). 4 months of night sweats vanished in 2 days by christmas time. in january 06, i got babesia symptoms coming back (a bit changed though).  i started with salt/c in october/november 05, then added buhner's herbs in december 05, slowly.  in jan-feb 06, i dropped salt/ c due to high blood pressure. i continued on buhner's herbs only, but couldn't really ramp up.  in february and march 06, i was spending most time in doctors, hospitals and emergencies. no hope, no diagnosis. i went to belgium too to try to get help. none.  in april, i found two art practioners (following dr.k's line of treatment, recommended by gigi a lymenet member who cured herself with this method). it was great help. one was a doctor, the other a naturopath. since then i was treated with homeopathy, the microcurrent (kmt 24) plus buhner's herbs. i also took out my amalgams and started a metal detox program.  slowly, but steady, i improved, with ups and downs, but the general curve going upward. by december 06, i had lots of energy, i could drink wine, could stay up late nights without much fatigue.  the naturopath treated my scar (from cesarean), taught me to do mft tapping after herb intake, treated intestinal parasites and brain parasites twice in 2006, and helped immensely with metal detox and detoxing in general.  i also did some lymph drainage massage and it also worked well for relief.  i guess the tick pathogens i had were 'only' borrelia, babesia and bartonella.  bartonella symptoms appeared more clearly only in the end of 2006 (without reinfection that i know).  in march 07, i found a part time job, that's where i am. i don't feel cured, i'm still on maintenance protocol (knotweed tea 3x day, cats claw very low doses) but that's all (immunomodulators). i recently added eleuthero extract, and i have been taking a variety of bee/ hive products.  i'm still treating an ancient fungal infection (skin), pre-lyme, but even that seems to be finally going. i did rizols, now i'm on pau d'arco tincture and frozen garlic again for that.  i feel almost normal, energetic, but still keep my diet (organic when possible, no wheat, practically no sugar, no milk derivates) and a few cleansing supplements (chlorella, magnesium, zeolite, some minerals, enzymes) plus the 2 buhner's herbs above (just in case).  i'll keep these 2 buhner's herbs until next winter, i guess. probably add some astragalus during high tick season in case of reinfection.  i still have chills sometimes (i don't know if this is lyme or bartonela or funghi), but that's about all.  my whole story is scattered in lymenet's archives, protocol included. i'm now an active member of the yahoo buhner's forum.  i still would like to treat my jaw problems, root canals, but didn't do it for financial reasons.  so my path of healing was:  - buhner's herbs (since december 05 until now march 07), in low doses, level 1 mostly. andro being my magic herb for 13 months.  - lots of cleansing. continuous and changing supplements/ herbs (except for the constant chlorella, milk thistle, enzymes, minerals).  - homeopathic support (following art, to suppor each organ in stress like brain, lymph system, liver, intestines etc. i felt it helped a lot!!!); i did it since april 06 until a week ago, always through art tests.  - amalgam removal and cleasing metals following art and an experienced naturopath from germany. the products she used were phospholipid exchange, ndf-plus, bear garlic, chlorella. i used cilantro tincture sometimes by myself or to rub.  - eating habits have changed as i eliminated wheat and all milk derivates (tested allergic through art).  - art tested for me buhner's herbs amounts and many other things (it could 'see' if my body was toxic, where was the problem, where were the pathogens, which pathogens, etc).  - kmt 24 sessions. art measured, sometimes. other times, by 'intuition'. i used it not every day, not every week, it depended on what i was treated. extremely useful for gastro-intestinal parasites and brain parasites, in my opinion.  - tapping always after herb intake (to help heb absorption), and my naturopath treated some pshychological blockages with tapping too.  - babesia: riamet, pc-noni, kmt were my treatments. symptoms vanished very fast.  - borrelia: innumerous things. mainly buhner's hebs, but i also used teasel tincture and some chinese herbs as tea.  - bartonella: so far, rizols, kmt, japanese knotweed. i don't know if it's gone though...  i hope this info could be helpful. selma^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"on a recent two week meditation retreat, which is the 8th one i have been on since sick over the last four years, i think i got to a new level of recovery.  after three days of silence and meditation, my pain level went from @ 8 (1-10 scale) to a 2-3. i titrated off morphine with no withdrawl, and was able to hike and do yoga for the first time in four years.  for those of you who don't know me, at this time last year i was bedridden, using wheelchairs to get around if it was more than a block, was very neurocognitive (could not read a sentence and make sense out of it), neuropsychiatric (having weird panic attacks and atypical depressions), and shaking like a person with advanced parkinson's.  this is the fourth ""phase"" i have noticed in 20 months tx.  the first was worsening due to ketek and ceftin. the next was improvement after 1 year abx orals and mepron (which just about killed my gi tract). the third was iv rocephin -- cleared the neuro cog and neuropsych stuff away almost completely. and the fourth has been ozone therapy, bee sting therapy, and the cumulative effect of mindfulness meditation and lovingkindness meditation.  i am able to work part time, take each day slowly, and can see that i might get up to 80% of my functioning back.  so if anyone is interested, my protocol looks a lot like dr. klinghardt's, much of which is posted on better health guy, scott's site.  a summary is: antibiotics - orals getting mercury out of fillings change of diet -- see burrascano, plus significantly less meat and sugar chlorella (for binding biotoxins for elimination from system) mepron (treating babesia) colonics (for detox from biotoxins) iv rocephin with biaxin ozone therapy (ozone mixed with blood and reinjected) bee sting therapy (currently up to 9 stings 3 times a week) mindfulness, meditation retreats ardent wish to get well support of family and friends no work for two years   so, again, i had / have a severe case. not as bad as some of our als, neuro mimicking lyme friends, but still really bad.  the next step i think is to continue the tx noted above, and to add more easy yoga, walking, and seeing what my doctors think.  it looks like i have hypothyroidism. apparently it is common in lyme. all i know is my temperature is 3 degrees too low, in the 95's, in the am and pm, and normal in middle of day. i thought my morning and night time fatigue were due still to brain swelling, but now i think it might be due to thyroid problems. we will see.  my daughter is not doing so well, but she is really only into @ 5 months of regular abx treatment, and does not regularly do the other self care things, particularly the simple one -- chlorella. we pray for her.  just sharing a very dramatic and positive turn. ifigure i have another couple of years to go. i wonder what i am going to do about cyst busters -- flagyl and tindi have been almost impossible to tolerate. i want to seriously try grapefruit seed extract.  hooray. maybe better health is possible!  -------------------- jeff"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0
lyme disease has been a part of my life for 12 years; spending many years camping and vacationing on long island, new york. as with many lyme victims i have suffered not only with the typical lyme symptoms but bizarre symptoms that are a direct result of spirochetes creating havoc in my body. i have been on oral antibiotics for over 18 months now, with little positive results or relief of symptoms. just 4 weeks ago i tried a mangosteen product. at this point, i will try anything just to feel better. the first two weeks were horrific with herxing, the most severe thus far. then after two weeks i started to feel better. i have been using this product for 4 weeks and it is unbelievable how fantastic i feel. you must know that i am aware that mangosteen may be simply helping with my symptoms and possibly not destroying spirochetes. i have been conducting a great deal of research trying to find the effects of xanthones and mangosteen on lyme. one of the findings is that mangosteen has a very effective anti-inflammatory agent and i do believe that has had the greatest impact on the improvement of the pain in my body and the ability to walk with much improvement. xanthone is a powerful, life-enhancing substance that is a natural antioxidant more powerful than many vitamins. xanthones have been the subject of intense research for several decades. they are found in a select number of rain forest plants, but nowhere are they found in more abundance than in the pericarp or rind, of the mangosteen fruit (garcinia mangostana). antioxidants function as a balance for free radicals in the body. free radicals are potentially harmful, yet oftentimes natural substances in your body that, when left free reign, build up and cause diseases like cancer, heart disease, and more. the xanthones function to travel through your body, literally mopping up the free radicals on their way, leaving your body cleaner and healthier than before. some of the most important xanthones found in mangosteen include: alpha-mangostin beta-mangostin gamma-mangostin garcinone garcinone a garcinone c garcinone d mangostanol gartanin these, among other xanthones, have been touted by independent researchers to have properties to include anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, anti-allergic, anti-tumor, and anti-platelet, to name just a few. it also has been found to be anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial. this could lead one to believe that there might be a possibility that mangosteen can be effective in eliminating spirochetes. all i know is that i am substantially better after just 4 weeks on mangosteen. if you want more information or just to talk, you can email me. dr. gwen larson morris^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
i got a great report today. after years of being sick this is the best i have felt in a long time. i would say i am 90% better and i continue to keep improving. i would just like to encourage everyone who is trying to overcome this horrible disease to hang in there, it does get better. six years ago i almost died, today i am planning on starting a family this summer. i am finally starting to laugh and enjoy life again.^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0

"it all depends upon what we perceive as ""success"".  i am so glad to read about the ""full successes"".  my llmd wants full success -- no more symptoms. i am happy to define success as: 1. being able to function better, for at least part of the day. 2. being able to work some and make a little money. 3. being out of a wheelchair and able to travel. 4. getting brain-clear again.  for me, this is a double-edged sword. at some times during the day, and on some full days, i am still very, very sick. but during other times, i can function, read again, walk some, and manage my pain.  i am grateful for this, and if this is the way the rest of my life went, it would be ok. i prefer to look at any improvement with tremendous gratitude. i am also grateful that this disease has taught me much more profoundly how to love and take care of myself.  so all i am saying, or adding to this thread, is that ""success"" is relative, and if we only define it as full cure / remission, we could get discouraged. and part of my treatment is to try to not let those discouraged thoughts come in and take over.  -------------------- jeff"^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0

"hi fellow lymies,  i am so glad this topic is here. i remember when i used to come here looking for help and i always liked hearing the success stories. there is hope out there.  gosh i am not sure how long ago it was for me ..i think about 5 years ago. i was living in southern nj. i was sitting down watching tv and felt something . sure enough it was a tick and this was in november! i pulled it out. well the site was very itchy and i went to the doctor because i wanted it documented. see, i had an angel back then. there was a woman i met in an online chat room. i always kept in contact with her. she has lyme and would tell me all about what was going on with her. i didn'thave it at this time.  i told her i found a tick and she told me to go the doc. the doctor told me to watch for a rash and flu-like symptoms. within two days, i had a sore throat. i didn't put the two together. i just thought i had a cold. then, the left side of my face went numb. thank god for this symptom. it was a scary symptom and made me go look on the internet. i googled facial numbness and received numerous hits on lyme. so i went back to the doctor who reprimanded me for looking it up on the internet. she told me the ""worse case scenarios"" are always on there and make people think they have something they don't.  she put me on a ten day antibiotic treatment. within days, i felt 100% better. my prescrip. ended and within days i felt terrible. i had burning in my back. my legs went numb off and on. i always described them as ""feeling like they didn't want to work"". i went back to the doctor who refused to give me antibiotics. i told her ""but i felt better on them, and as soon as it was done, i got worse."" i also explained that to me it made sense...on antibiotics =felt better..off=felt worse..i didn't understand what the problem was. she said we had to do other tests.  so thousands of dollars later...just like you all..they couldn't find any other explanation. my western blot was normal...my pcr's were normal. so now i had either cfs, or a mental disorder.  my angel directed me to this site...where i found an llmd and tons of support. i went to the llmd who treated me and tested me. i came back pretty positive. my tick was also the one with the white dot..which my doctor refused to believe ..i think it was the lonestar tick?  anyhow i have moved and been to another llmd who continued my treatment. i was so close to remission...only symptom left was floaters. then i got pregnant. i was treated my entire pregnancy with antibiotics. when my daughter was born, everything was fine and i felt wonderful.  to this day i am still in remission! stress has not made it come back. sometimes i think with all my allergy problems and sometimes my back burns...that maybe it's coming back..but so far so good. it could also be that i am getting older!!  my daughter was fine up until about 8 months. she started screaming in her sleep. it was obvious to me that it was a pain cry. at her pediatricians , i mentioned it since it got worse and worse. she would cry most of the night and arch her back. her doctor told me that she was manipulating me and to go get a book on how to get her in her own bed to sleep. she slept with me while this was going on so i could keep an eye on her.  i went home and cried that day. i knew he was wrong..but had no idea what was wrong with my baby. then she ended up getting an enlarged breast bud. the dr. called it premature thelarche and said it was normal and would go away. it didn't . when she was about 1 or 2 i insisted on a specialist. we were sent to an endrocrine doctor who was quite aggressive and listened to me.  i told her i knew my daughter was in pain and she would hold her back. the gave her an ultrasound and we found she had ovarian cysts. they said it seems she might be going through premature puberty. but she didn't fit the profile. her doctor was highly confused. she had an mri. this showed a pineal cyst on her brain. i was so scared. but then i started putting it together. cysts? i remember a lot of lyme patients had those. she was only two with cysts. she also started to go through a cycle. one week out of the month, she was unbearable. so grumpy and would cry. it was almost as if she was having her time of the month...which is exactly what was happening without the period. the cysts were giving her an influx of estrogen.  i took her to my llmd..who tested her and she came back positive. infact she was cdc positive. we got her on antibiotics and she is doing ok right now. her endrocrine doctor is following her and might even write a paper. she says she has a couple of kids who were l ike my daughter...and didn't fit the ""profile"" for precocious puberty...she wonders if it could be lyme for them too. my daughter does still have some problems..her tube in her kidney might be too short, she has already had her tonsils out..but for the most part, she doesn't have pain anymore and is a happy well adjusted kid.  i am so sorry this is so long. i just wanted to share my story to give others hope..as i have had from visiting this site. i haven't followed lyme in a little bit..but recently came back to find out the latest and sign the petition. i can't believe it is still so bad..i wrote oprah today...trying to get anything out there about lyme. i will keep writing my letters..  even though i am in remission...i am still a lymie..and i support all of you and wish you the best. i will do what i can to help get this topic out in the mainstream!  -------------------- jenn"^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0
"click here for my general lyme experience. so far, it's lookin; pretty good. if i hadn't found lymenet and kept on going back to the 'conventional' ...'doctors'..., i would no doubt still be sick. i had enough relapses and knew little enough about lyme at the outset to absolutely and totally negate any kind of 'placebo effect'... it is a fact- we're talkin, fact, that a substantial (i'm not at all only case i know of with this kind of experience) number of instances of lyme disease can be cured through extended treatment with antibiotics at high doses. it is possible that some case may require additional therapies; at the very least, these speed recovery and help one rebuild more quickjly afterwords. i have a friend who was greatly helped by 'rife'machines, for esample. (i didn't use these, but took many supplements and saunas.  another thing that i believe can help is meditation and ""prayer"", as long as such is truly helping to focus one's mind and life energy on eradicating the diseases and achieving wellness. that was a huge factor for me. and support from people is very important, too. if you're in a space where support seems hard to come by, it's worth putting some thought into finding this support. i was greatly helped through meeting others who were fighting lyme too, here in ithaca and nearby cities. lymenet was a great source of support and information for me as well; i strongly encourage anyone who can to support lymenet in every way possible!  prayin' for it all day, and fightin' for it all night, we need <a href=""http://www.elyrics.net/go/t/todd_rundgren/just_one_victory/"">just one victory</a>, it will be alright! best wishes to all who are fighting this horrible disease! <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bluecayuga"">daves</a>  (***note- i tested this before, but now, either it's this ...'windows'... computer i'm testing, or the lymenet pages have been ""downgraded"" so you can no longer enter urls-- if the latter is the case you'll have to copy the addresses into your browser address space-- sorry about that....! (i'm apolegizing for the ""downdaters"", or whoever is responsible for this bug, i guess...)-- this is the one kind of ""downgrading"" we don't need, folks!)

breaking up above post so all can read it:   just an update. i took a month of doxycyline, had terrible foot and toe cramping. it was one antibiotic i didn't take much in all my years of treatment.  the plan now is to go on rifampin and clarithromycin for the next 90 days. i've been told i could end up with a port in my chest doing rocephin iv as well.  i did one year of rocephin iv in 2008. i have chronic lyme (took dr.'s over 1 year to diagnose me).  i just had an mri for lumbar pain last week. i am seeing a neurosurgeon at stanford and ucsf. i may have to have lumbar surgery. i've been told i need it but i honestly feel it could be lyme.  i'm not doing surgery till i do at least four months of antibiotics to see if it makes a difference. it did in 2015 and bought me two years of no back surgery.  no one has to sell me on chronic lyme, i've had it for over 10 years and tend to have to treat every year for a minimum of three months. thank you all for your replies, it was helpful and very supportive. i very much appreciate it.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"update on this. my symptoms have gotten much worse, especially leg weakness. i can't ""power through"" it anymore and can only walk slowly.  i sometimes feel like i may fall down. still sporadic other joint pains, tingling in the shoulder, etc.  i found a local llmd and got the first avail appt.: oct 26th. i don't think i can last that long, so i have an appointment with my pcp tomorrow morning and am going to ask for a 30 day course of doxy.  i will bring with me some papers from cdc, john's hopkins, etc. showing that it is the recommended starting treatment even if no pos test results. (i got a neg elisa/blot test least year). doc is a pretty good guy and probably a good chance he will prescribe the doxy.  other thoughts recommendations? i have read up on possible side effects and herx reaction. if i get on doxy and herx, is that a good sign? have others here herx'ed if so, after how long on what?  this is really getting scary, i have never felt this weakness before, i feel like a 90 year old man sometimes.  usually worse in the morning, and gets better in the latter part of the day. at least that is what the last week has been like,  thanks for any insights...

"get a copy of the lyme test that your doctor did on you. take that to your first lyme doctor appointment.  also, post it here. the reason? often a doctor who does not specialize in lyme will tell a person ""your test was negative"" but when we or a lyme specialist look at it, it isn't negative at all!!!  so true! so, get a copy and type your results here for us to tell you if there is evidence of lyme.  the overall result of the western blot test may be a summary word like ""negative"" but lyme docs look at the specific bands on the test and if certain ones are positive or indeterminate, that is evidence of lyme. i would not expect your pcp to know that.  also, there is a lyme doc in maryland, not far from d.c., who can see you right away if you want to consider coming here for lyme treatment. he will do telephone appointments also, so you only have to appear in person once every 3 months.  let me know if you want the name.  i would call more lyme specialists if i were you and see if one can see you sooner. plus, keep calling the one that gave you the oct. appointment and ask if they happen to have any cancellations. call every few days.  having to wait until october is like being consigned to hell until october. at least, that is what it was like for me when i was ill. so, if there is some lesser doctor (perhaps one that is just lyme friendly--is willing to treat people for lyme for long periods) start out with him.  you always have to wait for the best doctors. so, go to a lesser doctor who can see you quickly and work your way up to the doc you really want.  that or fly here. think about it. do more research. see what you find.  we will help you here all we can.  regarding your questions, if you start doxy and herx on day 2 or 3, that is proof that you have lyme. a herx can be just total exhaustion or it can be a worsening of your current symptoms or new symptoms that pop up.  be careful with doxy. do not go out in the sun, and do not put your arm out the window when driving. you can get a doxy burn on your hands very easily in the summer. it is a chemical burn.  you can get the burn through the windshield, so be careful, especially with your hands.  take the doxy in the middle of a full meal. otherwise, it will upset your stomach and eventually you will be vomiting and have to stop treatment.  it doesn't matter that you are instructed to take it on an empty stomach. all the lyme docs say to eat half a meal, take the doxy, then eat the other half of the meal.  and, don't lay down for at least 30 minutes afterwards or the doxy could come up in your throat and burn your throat badly. you don't want to experience it.  you don't want to experience the doxy burn either, so stay out of the sun. take this very seriously.  let us know what kind of a reaction you have to the doxy. you may have your proof of lyme very soon."^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
are you on treatment for babs & bart, as well as bb?? i ask, because i got bitten again once when i was first in treatment, after i finally started to feel a little better. it had been attached a while, too, i think.  anyway, i made an emergency call to my llmd's, as it was a memorial day weekend. i started on doxy as i wasn't on that, so it would cover ehrlichia/anaplasma.  but, in spite of that, i went downhill. then, my llmd & i figured out: i wasn't on anything for babesia, which i already had, but apparently got re-exposed to.  so, depending on what you're on, that's something to be aware of.  and, yes, sadly, i wouldn't garden. awful, i know. tc, do you garden, or would you?  given how bad they are this year, i don't know what i'm going to do about leaving the city at all. i cannot afford another bite! i'm not on treatment (should be, but am fighting breast cancer). i am fighting for my life as it is.

200mg twice a day should be sufficient...you will need a gut left .. doxy sure wipes out all the good bacteria....besides being very hard on the stomach.  be sure to take probiotics two hours away from the doxy.  --------------------  oops! --lymetutu-- opinions, not medical advice!^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

ladies...why will all our docs only prescribe 1 100 mg doxy and say that's all we need. how can i find a gov here in nh...or mass or maine...or even vt who will give me 6 weeks doxy and hopefully nystatin i've had a few bites over the yrs and when docs wouldn't prescribe i would order fish doxy. i can buy artemesia and buhner herbs. but i'm recovering from mastectomy and knee replacement and just don't want to risk these infections...plus i'm too old for this. i can't wait months for real llmd and it will be hard to pay 600 to have them scoop head out and give me doxy^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i did the ilads treatment for lyme, bartonella, and babesia for two years then switched over to a natural treatment (photons, i went to germany). the only time i felt improvement on ilads treatment was when i was on the mepron/biaxin, so i guess you'd say it worked okay.  the problem was, anytime we switched me to a weaker treatment, the babesia came right back. we tried high doses of malarone, but i declined.  the zith caused an extraordinary amount of pain and fatigue. i went from seeing improvement to being as sick as i was before treatment. we even tried cutting it back to a pulsed therapy. i was miserable. i had been in treatment for well over a year and had seen improvement. i switched from biaxin to zith and was in tears in bed all day again.  -------------------- sixgoofykids.blogspot.com^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
hi everyone, it's been a while since i posted on this site but i was curious about something and do not currently have an llmd (i did have one, apparently one of the best in the world, but she dropped me dec 2015 after i failed treatment).  anyway, i recently tested positive for tuberculosis. i had the blood test not the test where they put the needle under your skin. when i asked if it was a false positive the nurse said no because it was the blood test, so they saw the infection in the blood. it is latent tb so i'm not actively ill or contagious. i am currently waiting on the chest xray but i'm not symptomatic so i'm sure it will come back clear.  so, my question is whether this could have affected my past treatment. i did 6 months iv abx (doxy, invanz, flagyl, zithro) and saw no improvement. could tb be considered a coinfection? can it affect treatment outcomes? has anyone else in here had this happen as well? am i taking a risk by not treating the tb? they offered me treatment but seeing as how i'm not doing well and antibiotics make me feel pretty sick i'm guessing it may do more harm than good.  any thoughts would be appreciated.  -------------------- i have severe light sensitivity so please be patient as i have difficulty using a computer.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

ty for reply. i think i'm ok. i'm a week into 400mg doxy a day. long history but major tx about 20 yrs ago. i'm on omeprazole and have not had reflux for awhile. i mostly sleep upright for other reasons  this is the sx...never happened before. i had been asleep a short time. i woke feeling like i had been punched in left chest. it made my whole body jump in the bed. i even thought i might have been shot.  i was pretty shook up. i took an aspirin. my bp was slightly elevated. bp has been high ish since last surgery in feb. i had urgent bm...that was wierd too. helped me realize i wasn't dreaming tho  there was a long period of time i had sharp chest pains and went to er and it was always dx as refluxor costochondritis...this was very different. no chest pain. normally i take reflux med and muscle relaxant and then sx stop so i don't go to er...but i didn't have those sx. and i haven't had a musc relaxant since before oct when i started with histamine problems...cuz its high hist...and i didn't want to add anything unknown to what was going on  yesterday i had 2 doc appts and felt really good.. did errands and some gardening  one appt was 2nd visit to chiro for 3 yo pain in rib on right side. i was afraid it was cancer from breast cancer that we missed...its supposed to be gone after mastectomy  but this rib pain is 3 yrs old and trying to figure it out is how we found cancer  chiro said rib is twisted. first tx made it better for 2 days. 2nd tx yesterday was more aggressive with tapper. he said rib had moved but wasn't right and my neck was extremely tight. so he worked on those 2 spots  i forgot about that tx possibly causing last nights problem. when i fell asleep my last thought was that the rib pain had moved from under my arm much closer to rib cage  who knows. good answer s here about heart block not causing pain. heart stuff is one thing i haven't learned much about cuz it is one thing so far i haven't been dx with  its in the back of my mind tho cuz i've been obese a ling time and have high lipid a long time and now last 5 months bp getting higher and erratic and my dad died of heart attack  so ty. i feel pretty good and i'm taking meds. what a trip this disease is.  i haven't talked to you guys in so long but seeing your names i just relaxed cuz i know you know and i was getting the best info i could. ty.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i agree. be sure you only take the doxy in the middle of a full meal. otherwise, it can tear your stomach up.  and, do not lay down for at least 30 minutes after you take it. otherwise, it could come up in your throat and burn you.  doxy is hard to tolerate.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
heart attack? heart block? what does heart block feel like? i woke up in middle of night feeling like i was punched in chest. i've been on doxy 400mg a day for a week for new tick bite. ty  [ 07-14-2017, 01:50 pm: message edited by: lpkayak3 ]^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
thank you so much keebler and tnt, this is so helpful. my llnd hasn't really talked to me about liver support all this time; she did give me a tincture called biopure 'cocktail' does this support the liver? at the moment i'm not taking it but maybe i should.  i stopped taking alinia and my abx for a couple of days and felt better, much less anxiety but now i feel the pain coming back so i starting things up again, this time cutting my alinia tablet in half to take 250 2x/day.  would systemic enzymes be an appropriate addition to lower inflammation?  i follow the magnesium root cause protocol (morley safer) i also have hashimotos from the lyme and am on t4 and slow release t3, my llnd manages my thyroid. i generally follow the ray peat dietary principles (not low carb). reformer pilates 5 times a week to try and recondition my body.  -------------------- bit in 2008. diagnosed and began tx in 2014. remission in late 2015, all tests clear. back to cdc positive wb in early 2017. currently on iv abx.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i take the 10 mg .. i stay low and slow! ha!! pepcid and zantac used to make my stomach hurt.. now i can take pepcid. i think it's the food colorings i can't handle.  i take zyrtec as it's more effective for me than claritin. claritin also began to keep me wired and i couldn't sleep. zyrtec can make you drag a bit though.  quite often, i will take 1/2 zyrtec in the morning and 1/2 at bedtime.  --------------------  oops! --lymetutu-- opinions, not medical advice!^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i take it. zantac makes my stomach hurt.  i take only one pepcid per day .. many with mcas take at least two per day.  i also pair it with zyrtec, which i take one per day. i'm stubborn and try to function on the least amount of drugs i can.  you do need to take an h1 and an h2 for the synergistic effect.  --------------------  oops! --lymetutu-- opinions, not medical advice!^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
thanks lymetoo! are your pepcid pills 10mg or 20mg? i think it's two 20mg pills that a lot of people probably take.  he actually recommended taking three h1 blockers with it. that seems a little much right now so i'll probably start with just claritin as an h1 blocker and see how that goes.  i already seem to feel a little better from the pepcid and i just started yesterday. i'm kinda surprised.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i can't say i have no quality of life, as i have 2 functioning hours per day. then back to bed or couch.  pain and fatigue are big right now.  i have no research or teaching university near by.  hopingandpraying praying, i went to your link and found another really good llmd that i tried to see last year but it would have been a 6 month waiting period. so i got in with the holistic nurse practitioner from the same office.  i was treated for 6 months with herbs, silver, reki, muscle testing, essential oils, and 200 mg a day of doxy only. i responded great for 1 month and then got even sicker.  dbpei, my last 2 treatment of ivig, i almost didn't get them because my blood pressure was so low. i had to drink fluids and wait an hour till it would come up. after i get a treatment, i get a burst of energy. but the next couple of days i m wiped out. so i ve wondered the exact same thing you have. are we getting exposed to more viruses and bacteria. i wish i knew the answer. my original blood work showed i had no measle antibdies. now, 6 months later, they are sky high. so that means donor ig gave me measle antibodies or i was exposed to the measles through contact and now have the measles ! the blood work doesn't differentiate between past or present infections.  still waiting on results from second tick bite this season, which are long overdue. but i could have written wrong e-mail address because i couldn't keep my eyes open at that point.  and i was so close to getting my mojo back. . . 💔^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
rumi he prescribed 28 days of doxy 200mg am and pm plus 4 nystatin s a day and he knows i am on sbc and vsl3  he also gave me two bottles of meds 15 drops each i don't know names of them ...i can get that for you...they are for nabs and bart  he wants to see me in a month to see how i'm doing. the practice has rules about communication with doc between appts. again i'm not sure but i think its 5 emails less than 500 words. or fax or letter  if i herd i'm supposed to tell him and see what he wants me to do  i think that's it. oh. i decimated the tick trying to get it out. so all that was left was a scab. he didn't cut it out so there is nothing to test  he knew early llmd s that treated me...he obviously respected them....and more...it was so wonderful to talk to someone who knew more than me. its been at least 12 yrs since i had regular contact with ll people and docs.  i was beside myself this time last night. i know things happen for a reason and i guess that stupid tick got me so i could finally connect with office  the seeking ppl should be sure to have this office i'm sure they do.but they can pm me if they need info^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
hi all. i just want to say ty. sammy i hope you don't live in a body like mine but it sounds like you really understand. something happened recently here and all medical docs refuse to remove ticks or prescribe more than one 100mg doxy for an engorged tick. also...in the last few weeks the vets are giving dogs 2 doses...12 hrs apart and saying that is only tx needed  i don't know why. a local person on fb gave me the name of np office half hour from me. they have a 20-30 min acute tick bite option for 150. i have been unable to afford their prices to use them as my primary but this worked very well for me. i am on 1 month doxy plus baba and bart herbal and nystatin. i already have myself on s b c and vsl3  i think there will be a way to see them when necessary. all docs around here are ignorant of lyme and tickborn diseases. they are mentally abusive. i can't describe how good it felt to be in the care of a lyme literate doc  ty again to all who responded.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"i don't think so.  a tick will stay attached to you for a few days, generally. so, if that tick had bitten you or your daughter, i suspect you would have eventually seen or felt it.  i don't think a lyme specialist will treat you just because you found a tick in your bed. he might test you if you wanted testing.  i know that pediatric lyme docs will not treat a child if the child has no symptoms. even if the child tests positive for lyme, if the child has no symptoms they will not treat. they say to leave well enough alone.  they say that the child's immune system must be handling the infection. so, for these reasons they will not give the child treatment.  i know you are uneasy, and i would be too. but, i don't think i would go to any doctor based on just seeing a tick in my bed. my guess is that it didn't get onto either one of you, but i didn't see it.  i would have captured it in a pill container and examined it to see what type of tick it was and if it truly was swollen at all.  still, i don't think i would go to a doctor just for that.  my husband gets 3-4 ticks on him each year. they are attached when he finds them. i would be taking him to the doc all the time if i treated a tick bite that way. in the beginning (like first 2 years after i got rid of lyme), i called his primary and got 2 weeks of doxy for him and once when a red rash as big as a nickle developed, i took him to a dermatologist, but she said it was just normal reaction to an insect bite. now i no longer contact a doctor.  we have gone 10 years handling his tick bites this way. but, i continually watch him for symptoms. i mark the date of the bite on the calendar and i keep the tick in a pill container with a moist cotton ball so it doesn't dry out.  this way, if i want to send it away for testing, i can. but, since nothing has come of any of his bites, i have never gone any further than this.  there is a place out west that is currently testing ticks for free. so, if you find another one in your house, you may want to send it away for testing. the testing is not 100% accurate, but it would be interesting to see the result.  look at pictures of swollen ticks on the internet and see if that is what your tick looked like.  just type into google ""tick after blood meal picture"" and many will come up. the tick no longer looks like a tick. it looks like a blown up balloon. a big difference.  it would not stop feeding until it was blown up like a balloon. so, if it wasn't blown up like these pics, that means that it did not feed on anyone."^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
no here they give one 100mg doxy for attached tick and insist you will be fine  i need to get meds on my own  any normal infection near replaced knee is a real concern tho  thx. i used to buy fish doxy but i'm getting scared with all the narcotics and crazy stuff going on  maybe i should just put myself back on buhner^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
is there an urgent care place that you could go to?? and have you heard anything about how they treat tick bites?  omg, when, oh, when will these guys learn??!!  or do you have a pcp who would be good with it? if so, surely you would have thought of it.  last summer when i had a tiny tick, i thought, embedded, i went to urgent care to a derm, as it was really embedded, totally on spec, not expecting it to work out. to my total surprise, she was wonderful, got it out & sent it to pathology (it wasn't a tick!), & gave me the doxy rx that i asked for! no guarantees on that one, however.  but i wouldn't advise what the stupid doctor said, of course. grrrr!  ps is your surgeon in town? can you see him to take it out? unorthodox, but he's the one concerned, so hopefully he would care the most about the outcome.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"i have a small embedded tick...very small...nymph...or what they are calling seed ticks now....well bigger than a period(.) but smaller than a deer tick...  it is behind the knee i recently had revised(2nd replacement) there have been some problems with healing...doc is very concerned about not getting it infected. that's my regular surgegeon...he's the one concerned. tonight i talked to ortho on call and he said...""cover it with bacitracin...cover it with a bandaid and maybe it won't be able to breathe and it will back out.""  ok...so i'm an old lymie. been dealing with this over 38 yrs now. i rarely get bit but when i do i've learned not to go to docs cuz they just laugh or refuse to remove tick and offer you one 100mg doxy and say you are fine i take the tick off myself and start myself on doxy.  but this tick is so tiny and/or so deep i can't get it off. i have bad arthritis in hands. i do have really good instrument from vet to take it off and it has always worked before. i'm thinking about digging it out with needle but i'm really scared about infecting the new knee  what do you think. won't the bacitracin bandaid thing just make it regurgitate more? d@m...grrr...how long will it take for these docs to ....nevermind. i know why.  but those of you who have been around. how would you handle it. i guess 200 doxy should help some...since its still attached 24 hrs later...i can steal the dogs doxy.  but do you think i should put bacitracin on or just wash with soap and water...or just water...please tell me what you think  i only have a few days of doxy. is there a way to buy without prescription? ty."^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
hi! anyone herx from mepron/zithromycine for babs with a specific rash? llmd says a certain rash is common with the herx and these 2 meds?  i had a rash the first week and now had to stop the meds. want to know if it's the same kind of rash he's referring to??  stopped treatment until other reactions calmed down for now. very tough road😫.  thanks for any input from anyone who's been in this protocol fir babs🌺!^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i did not do well on doxy, but i love bactrim. unfortunately, everyone's body is different and most of the time we have to wait and see how we react to each med.  i would follow your dr.'s advice on when to take. my dr. has always been under the direction that constant antibiotics is better than pulse.  my llmd also suspects bart.  hang on for the ride. it does get better, but it is slow with lots of ups and downs.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
foxy, dr. h. gave a talk in april in which he mentioned many of the side effects that make it impossible for many people (1/3 of all patients) to take dapsone.  i took notes on this talk. here are the notes on dapsone:   treatment of lyme--dapsone  1:36:40 plaquenil hits the cyst form of lyme. serapeptase and neutramedix stevia hit biofilms.  1:38 using persister drugs—dapsone. 1:39 for a small percent of patients, you must pulse the dapsone to get rid of persisters. old tb persister drug (perizinimide) helped a patient with bartonella nodules on her hands (misdiagnosed as behcet’s). this drug goes inside the cells.  1:41:30 dapsone is used for leprosy, but it hits persisters and parasites and hits autoimmune illnesses. it gives a herx, so go slow!! or pulse it (25 mg every other day). work up to 100 mg.  it also causes anemia, can give rashes (it is a sulfa drug), and can cause methemoglobinemia (a blood disorder).  1:43:20 also, you can’t carry oxygen, so you can get blue hands and lips. so, consider dapsone if you have failed all other lyme drugs. it is very effective for neuro lyme symptoms.  if you failed all babs drugs, also consider it.  1:45:28 we don’t know the effective dose and the length of treatment necessary to completely eliminate persisters. the higher the dose of dapsone, the better. doxy, rifampin, and dapsone is most effective combo (using 3-4 intracellular drugs together)  1/3 of patients cannot take dapsone due to its side effects.  1:49 it does not affect your gut, so no candida concerns  1:50 summary: you must treat all 3 forms of lyme. his new book goes into dapsone treatment. they are doing a study so insurance will pay for treatment with dapsone.   all of my notes on this talk can be found at this thread:  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=136070;p=0  the numbers next to the notes tell you the exact minute and second on the video at which the subject is discussed.  so, to hear the full discussion of dapsone, just go to the video and advance it to 1 hour, 36 minutes, 40 seconds.  here is the video link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu0weofvm8^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i think without a doubt you have to weigh the risk to reward ratio on some of these antibiotics, especially dapsone. it's a strong drug, but i think you also should not blow things out of proportions and try to understand studies first before jumping to conclusions.  hyepersensitivty leads to death, it happens, seems to happen lot more with the sulfa drugs, hence bactrim. lot of allergic reactions to these antibiotics than most.  considering the lastest report on lyme suicides, i'm curious myself to see how many patients a drug like dapsone could of helped, before they decided to take their own life. even just being at 60-70% is not a life to live for some people, especially when you've been that way for like 5-10 years long. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/07/19/how-lyme-disease-might-triggering-hundreds-suicides/493934001/  i for one, would consider taking the drug at a low low dose, 25mg a day, to prevent hyepersensitivty. dr. h mixing drugs together which only increases the chance of hyepersensitivty. for me, dapsone has given me incredible results at 25mg a day with stevia. dr. h is a brilliant man, but remember it's your life, taking risks combining antibiotics together may not be worth it. especially when longterm treatment in low dose maybe just as effective with dapsone.  this drug has a long long long half life for me, it builds up in the system even at 25mg, breaks are a must, be careful and take care, i think tincup posting this is well deserved regardless of maybe reading the study wrong.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
has anyone heard about treatment for lyme using argentyn  23-silver hydrosol thru picc line? the treatment is 4  days/wk for one month, dose increasing every few days?  cost is $5000/1 month!!! and have you also heard of  ultraviolet light treatment 2-3/week thru peripheral iv, each  treatment lasts an hr and is $240 each, with 30 treatments  recommended ($7200)?? does any of this really work on  killing lyme or is this a money maker? let me know, this is  being offered by tn doc. i'm very worried that this is a rip off and has no science behind it as working..^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
can't do zantac, guess i'll have to try pepsid again, gave me headache years before.  are you taking singulair too for leukotrienes? aspirin or advil?  my llmd wants me on a h1 and h2 blocker, ketotifen(can't do),singulair, advil or aspirin, and maybe dao enzyme.  not likely to tolerate all that, my tinnitus gets louder with each med i take.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
can anyone throw me a source? i think i know more than my lyme literate doctor at this point, and i'm going a little nuts.  i found out we can generally get antiparasitics in the states without running into any red tape (from the same places you'd get meds for cattle), but no such luck with antibiotics. i bought some antibiotics from china a few times, but the quality was always very poor, not really fit for human consumption. so, where do you guys get your meds?  i'm looking for stuff like, tinidazole, flagyl, doxycycline, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dapsone, and pyrazinamide.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

how many ivermectin doses did your doctor give you, windingshores? were they correct for your body weight? i am not advocating this, but some people do use the equine paste version....in fact there are threads here that mention this, as some people have used iver daily for short periods as prescribed by some llmds as part of either a general parasite treatment or to target lyme itself.  you may find kleen green enzyme concentrate good for diluting and spraying on itchy parts or lesions and after a shower. it is also useful for spraying where you sit etc and as a cleaning product that also kills bugs. it is soothing to irritated skin. take care to avoid getting it in your eyes or breathing it in a lot, even though in itself it is non-toxic.  your friend with the black specks may find it useful to get a digital microscope so that the specks can be seen more closely and photographed.  good luck to you and your friend and, even though you do need to research online etc, try to limit the amount of time you spend on it in order to try not to get too depressed. i know that is easier said than done!

i've had bone pain last 5 days or so as well...thought maybe it's due to die off? ive been eating less sugar. and before the pain started, i went up on nystatin a few days (4 pills), then alternated b/t 3-4 pills. then when the pain started i went back down to 3.  then came the mouth pain/rawness. thought perhaps the supposed die off also was causing this. ive been trying to stave off what i think is a 'throat thing'--not sure what to call it...just irritated throat (i get it every couple years...it can get so irritated and kinda gaggy as a result that i throw up. i stay up literally all night in misery waiting for it to go away. so trying salt water, natural throat spray, hyd. peroxide gargle).  i use natural toothpaste and mouthwash. i dont think my mouth is irritated by them. crunchy foods dont really bother me either. the feeling in my mouth is pretty constant.  already have call into llnd. i saw the rec for the oil on your link. how do you use it? orally?^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"to educate yourself on this disease, read and study the burrascano lyme treatment guidelines found here:  http://www.lymenet.org/burrguide200810.pdf  read ""diagnostic hints"" at the top of p. 7. see the last sentence which says:  ""another very important factor is response to treatment- presence or absence of jarisch herxheimer-like reactions, the classic four-week cycle of waxing and waning of symptoms, and improvement with therapy.""  this is my basis for saying that if you herx on the doxy, that is proof of lyme. of course, if the dose of doxy is too low, you may not herx. a lyme specialist gives 200 mg twice per day, but regular doctors give just half of that.  still, some of your symptoms could improve with the doxy. that would also be proof of lyme.  see also on page 7 ""western blot"" which will tell you the bands on the western blot test that are significant to a lyme specialist.  this document will teach you how to evaluate any lyme treatment you get. many doctors treat lyme, but not many follow the burrascano guidelines anymore because the docs who do get persecuted so often by the state medical board.  i had undiagnosed lyme (and babesiosis and bartonella) for at least 10 years before a doctor figured out that it sounded like lyme and tested me for it. still, i got well once i found a lyme specialist who followed the burrascano protocol.  you really have to do a lot of research before going to a lyme specialist. you have to find out how they treat lyme. do they test for and treat the coinfections, etc. i wasted over 2 years with docs who treated lyme but they ignored coinfections.  it was 2 wasted years of taking antibiotics!  then, i switched to my burrascano type doctor and he tested me for all coinfections at my first appointment. i had babesiosis and bartonella, just like nearly every single lyme patient.  then, this doc treated me for all my diseases and i got well. that was over 12 years ago now. then, i sent at least 5 of my friends to burrascano type doctors and they also got well.  so, don't waste your time with a doc who won't do right. many doctors treat lyme, but very few know enough to get a person well.  here are a few points from dr. b's guidelines:  you must attack both the regular and cyst (or other) form of lyme simultaneously--requires 2 different antibiotics taken together to do so.  you must test the patient for all co-infections and other physical ailments (thyroid, etc.) and treat everything the person has.  you must treat all co-infections (including babesiosis, bartonella, ehrlichia, mycoplasma, etc.) or the patient will not get well.  you must use igenex for most of these tests--they are a tick-borne disease specialty lab in calif.  you must use very high doses of antibiotics to kill the diseases (batericidal doses).  you must give the patient supplements, probiotics, herbs such as artimesinin if babesiosis is suspected, and require adherence to rules such as low carb diet, no alcohol, no smoking, rest, and exercise as the patient is able to do it.  you must treat at least 2 months after all symptoms have disappeared (if sick at least 1 year).  these are just a few of the important points you will see in the guidelines. you want a doc who does everything burrascano says to do. he treated lyme for over 25 years, and compiled what he learned so that other docs could benefit from it. when he was practicing, they came from every country in the world to be treated by him.  look at burrascano's list of required supplements. notice the symptoms that each treats. try some of the supplements and see if they help your symptoms.  nearly every lyme patient is deficient in magnesium. so, buy some of the mag-tab sr that he recommends and take it for a few weeks and see if you feel better. i buy that mag online and it comes in a few days. take the dosage burrascano recommends.  if the doc you see does not do the important things burrascano says are required to get well, then start looking for another doctor.  that's why i say to do a lot of research before going to your first lyme specialist. it will pay off. a lyme specialist is a doctor whose entire practice is lyme disease, or at least half of the practice is lyme disease.  that is how a doctor develops expertise in this difficult to cure disease.  a lyme specialist's website will be all about lyme disease. it should also tell you how the doc believes in treating lyme. if he believes in just using herbs, look for another doctor. if he believes in herbs and ozone or some such thing, keep looking. you want a doc who uses combos of antibiotics together.  lyme can evade any one antibiotic. that is why you need at least 2 at once. (see ""combination therapy"" page 12). so,educate yourself. then, you will make a better choice of a first lyme doctor.  see pages 9--10 which is a list of lyme symptoms. make a list of all you have. be very thorough. give this list to your first lyme specialist. lyme is diagnosed mainly on symptoms since the tests are not reliable (see top of p. 7), so your list of symptoms is the most valuable thing you are giving the doctor.  look at the symptoms for babesiosis and bartonella also.  study, study. it will pay off immeasurably."^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"- the above articles, i hope, will serve as medical science explanations as to why it's not a good choice - nor is any single antibiotic, alone, a good choice for treatment.  so, why would there be a bunch of folks put on that for a study just to gather more data when it's shown to not be a good choice, alone.  as the questions is qualified by ""chronic lyme"" those doctors who really know & understand chronic lyme would not approach treatment in such a way as to suggest just a single antibiotic, it would be unethical, whether in a study or in a single patient.  it's also a terrible choice, alone, for anyone with lyme as lyme usually involves other infections, many of which are not helped by any antibiotic. so, again, sole abx treatment would be unethical.  add to that the experience of so many with chronic lyme. many, if not most, while likely diagnosed late, when finally got some kind of treatment with a typical doctor, also likely were just allowed a single antibiotic, not a combination protocol.  you may see some articles by idsa members that suggest a single dose of doxycycline - or a short course might be effective. but many who do not recover with this are discounted by ongoing symptoms that the idsa doctors will then claim are ""just the aches and pains of daily living."" -  [ 08-31-2017, 02:36 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"- http://lymemd.blogspot.com/2011/07/everything-you-thought-you-knew-about.html  lymemd blog - july 24, 2011  everything you thought you knew about cyst busters is wrong  excerpt:  . . . eva sapi's recent research calls into question everything we thought we knew about lyme ""cysts."" in fact it destroys the old thinking.  we have heard about cell wall antibiotics, intracellular antibiotics and cyst-busters. think again.  she investigated the effect of various antibiotics on lyme spirochetes and round body forms - also know as cystic forms.  doxycycline worked according to plan. doxy inhibits protein synthesis - it kills bacteria, including lyme, by action within the cytoplasm, inhibiting the manufacture of proteins required for the bacteria's survival. doxy and others are commonly referred to as intracellular antibiotics.  spirochete loads decreased by about 90%  while cyst levels increased by 200% - just as expected. . . . -"^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
- do you have an ilads educated lyme literate doctor?  lyme requires a combination approach with frequent rotations, whether with rx, herbal support or incorporating various modalities.  and there are other infections that often go with lyme for which antibiotics just don't work.  it's very complex. bottom line, though, no single antibiotic is appropriate treatment, especially in the chronic stage.  doxycycline (or other antibiotics), alone, can make lyme even more chronic as it forces spirochetes to go into the cystic form and antibiotics don't work with that form.  if this is a matter of it's all you've got, there are other ways to approach this. -^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

the emx dan is talking about (correct me if i'm wrong) was from www.rifelabs.com and this is where i bought one of the first machines dave made. i was referred to him by dt because i was in a hurry (just my personality).  i used the emem3d machine to get close to 95% better then added periods of antibiotics for 3-4 days at a time, once a month which got me back to 100%. also salt/c for a couple weeks.  i also spoke to dave numerous times throughout the time i was using it and he was a fantastic guy. unfortunately he just passed away a few months ago but lucky for those interested his son is taking over the business. i am not affiliated with anyone!  when i got better and returned to work i also bought a coil machine from www.coilmachines.com. i rarely used that one until now and it is pretty strong(just bitten again).  i was bit on nov.1 and used the following: i also have had breathing and sweat symptoms this time which the machines wipe right out - babesia? who knows - i did not have those symptoms years ago.  ...4 days of doxy - herxed  ...rifed with both machines 2 times a week - herxed each time  ...added another 3 days of doxy - felt better but no herx  been rifing 2 times a week since - herxed each time.  i'm trying to get to once a week.  almost 6 weeks and i've used 7 days of meds.  i'm not recommending anyone follow my treatment -this is just my choice.  detox is a definite.  i too will be interested to see how long this thread lasts.  all my best, scott  -------------------- btw - i am not a medical professional - just speaking from my own personal experience.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

mods: sorry for posting names; shall never happen again. (assumed people of that level of respect were, well nevermind...)   anyway, i've been thinking about herbals long-term. most of the vitamins i've taken have a concoction of herbs, so it'd be no different or worse, i suppose, in spirit.   many llmds things i've read, in addition to patients, and even things seen is episode 2 of a lyme documentary (am i allowed to post its title???) indicate herbs may work long term.   hoping for a silver bullet, because six weeks of doxy has eradicated 2 of my debilitating symptoms, but not touched the others. and, as you all know, its not 1,2,4 things bringing us down, it is about 12.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i had rmsf in the spring and it was no fun. the first symptom was severe rib pain. felt like someone had punched my intercostals over and over to the point i could barely stand up straight. tested positive and took a course of doxy and all other symptoms cleared, except i still have some rib pain. not as severe, but i certainly wonder why it is still there after over 4 months. it was surprising how fast i became ill. it was acute and sudden, and since i knew i had a tick bite, there was no question and they treated me on the spot, even before test came back. there is a person in our community who nearly died from it and she has lots of continuing issues. er and doc kept sending her home and totally missed it until it was almost too late. criminal that it happened in nc, where it is so prevalent.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
many of my llmd's have told me that chronic form of rmsf (and erlichia) is easy to treat with a few weeks of doxy and rifampin, which i did for several months. both types of antibodies no longer show up in my blood work, but they did before i took this combo.  treatlyme.net doc also says the same on his webinar and treat lyme book. bartonella, lyme and babesiosis are much harder to treat and cure.^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"the first time i saw my current llmd, after he looked at my labs he said ""ah, you survived rocky mountain spotted fever! that can be deadly you know."" i'm like, thanks doc, i'm glad i survived too...  the impression i got was that it's more acute and less chronic, and if you survive the first week that you're generally safe after that. but i can't say for sure. doxy is supposedly the go-to treatment, but i'm sure you know that already."^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i hear you overlyme...i also got increased pressure in my head. i had taken a long course of doxy and rifampin for bart. started getting daily headaches which i was told were herxheimer reactions. i had daily headaches for almost 9 months. they were dull headaches, not migraines, but still painful.  fast forward a year...i now have empty sella syndrome, raised prolactin levels and pulsatile tinnitus from increased pressure compressing pituitary gland. mind you i never had any of these symptoms before the doxy. i had joint pain, muscle twitching, insomnia from lyme/bart.  when i told my doctor that i read in numerous places that the tetracycline class of drugs could cause increased pressure, he totally blew it off.he said he had never heard of that, he didn't think that was true.regardless, i asked to stop taking the doxy, and he put me on azithromycin.   i am now under the care of an endocrinologist, neurologist and ophthalmologist to handle this situation that could have been prevented or lessened.  i still see that same lyme doctor. i can not afford another new patient consultation,and an extensive workup by switching to a new doctor. i just don't take everything he says as gospel anymore. a lot of this crap, unfortunately, we have to learn on our own.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"to answer your question -- the intracranial hypertension went away after i went off the tetracycline class of abx.... and i went off of diamox too. i managed to get my lyme more or less in remission, and kept it that way for a few years.... but...  just this month i was pretty sure i was relapsing, and my doc ordered lab tests. i'm igm postitive and one band shy of igg, and that is a test from quest (who are notorious for missing actual lyme cases!)  so -- i'm going back on oral antibiotics for a while, alongside a natural regimen, and hoping to achieve remission again that way.  i'm definitely herxing, and that is just from a low dose of biaxin. we're adding things in slowly so i don't get overwhelmed by die-off. my current doc has a pretty conservative approach medically, but fully supports a holistic protocol.

especially when i was undertreated or suffering from bad herx i would have extreme neck problems-stiff, aching neck. i believe it is caused from the lympth nodes in and around the neck. yes i know the extreme pain it causes.  my first suggestion is to assess whether you are receiving sufficient and/or effective treatment. though i use naturals to supplement, for me, an effective antibiotic regimen is absolutely necessary. so are you receiving adequate treatment. this includes a cyst buster like flayyll or tindamax.  also i use lot of aspirin for partial pain relief. aspirin is the only over the counter pain remedy that actually works for me. for major pain as you describe to get any relief i would have to take at least three (3)regular strength aspirin at the same time.  you have my sympathy and empathy. somehow, keep smiling.  still winning^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

there are some pr symptoms that do not overlap with other infections such as nasal congestion, pain in the teeth or jaw, stabbing nerve pain (not mentioned), and ho**** voice (also not mentioned). other symptoms not listed are bone, muscle and joint pain (protomyxzoa rheumatica). i think that list comes from dr. c and is posted on the internet.  how can you tell if it you have pr? you may have insomnia, bladder irritation, irritability, anxiety and twitching and think it is bart. you may have hot flashes, sweating, headaches behind your eyes, body pain, profound fatigue, inability to concentrate and air hunger, diagnosing babesia. however with babesia you would be oversleeping, not insomnia.  however now and then you lose your voice, talking like there is a frog in your throat. you get nasal congestion, perhaps thinking you have developed an allergy. sometimes you get a stabbing feeling in one tooth like you have a bad cavity but the dentist doesn't find anything. in winter your hands, feet and nose are so cold you just can't keep them warm. you get stabbing or tingling nerve pains in various parts of your body.   http://protomyxzoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/protomyxzoa_rheumatica.pdf  i tested positive so i know i have it. ivermectin wiped it out for me in a couple of months but i have to stay on the low fat diet or it comes back.  -------------------- old joke: idiopathic means the patient is pathological and the the doctor is an idiot^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

for me, i discovered, after trial and errors that...  no binders = no sleep.  no binders = night terrors. and day terrors.  no binders = high blood pressure, irregular heart beat.  no binders = anxiety to the top, crying sometimes, angry most of the times.  no binders = gut with loads of problems  no binders = tinnitus got much worse  no binders = air hunger (once i got my whole body paralyzed after a terrible air hunger attack). it felt like dying. i ended up in hospital, of course, they found nothing wrong with me.  since that day, i learned my lesson: while killing (abx, herbs, homeopathy or any method), i just add binders, at least 3 times a day.  in worse days, i took binders about 7 times!  i followed that for the whole time lyme disease treatment lasted. until lyme was no more with me.  today, i still take binders, but not every day.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
my herx always seems to be untouchable insomnia which leads to serious mental instability. my question is  how long will the insomnia last before i resume my normal level of insomnia?  i've tried 3 drugs. minocycline--horrible insomnia leading to suicidal thoughts  ceftin-- did ok on, but can't just be on ceftin forever and cure this thing.  dr. added doxy to the ceftin and sure enough untouchable insomnia.  do not want to give up. if i can't make it through treatment, i will never get better.  if i don't sleep, i won't make it through treatment.  sleep dr. has me on clonazapam and seeing sleep psychologist for behavior ...   neither help when i am going on antibiotics.  any help is welcome.... does it get better? should i just keep going?^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
- a sense of disassociation [if like being off kilter with space, motion, reading, walking, talking and, yes, even thinking]  can also be the result of vertigo, dizziness, balance or other inner ear issues that go with lyme and also (sadly) can be intensified by many rx if they are in the ototoxic category as many are.  be sure to check everything you take, even otc items. see the end of the links set below for bauman's list / new book. anything that is ototoxic and not absolutely required is best avoided.  liver support may help in some cases and should always - always - be on board.  vinpocetine is one nutrient supplement also to consider if you have any kinds of vestibular issues. it can really help lift some of the fog and sensory sludge, so to speak. sure has helped me at times.  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=065801  topic: tinnitus: ringing between the ears; vestibular, balance, hearing with compiled links - including hyperacusis  ototoxic drugs discussed - and what may help. -^0^1^0^1^0^0^^0^0^0^0

when you say your left ear is full, any possibility you could have a low-grade ear infection? that could cause the dizziness and off-balance feeling. i suggest checking in with a primary doc or ent specialist.  another thought - when the neck vertebrae c1 and c2 are subluxated, that can cause the symptoms you're describing. a good neck chiropractor can check on that.  no, it doesn't sound like candida symptoms to me. sounds more like the above or lyme symptoms acting up.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i've been off all antibiotics for a little over a year. in mid july i had an intense vertigo episode with vomiting, which lasted for several hours. since then, my left ear is full and i have been dizzy and off balance. i started having numbness and tingling again.  dizziness and numbness/tingling were some of my main symptoms after a tick bite, and they improved drastically with treatment, but never went away.  does this sound like a relapse? candida? something else?^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i recently got my thyroid checked.  t4 was low at 0.79 tsh was high at 4.36  i was wondering if anyone found treating hypothyroid to help with overall symptoms?  my hair is falling out, i get spikes of anxiety and my head feels odd and weird all the time. i have brain fog and often feel strange sensations in it.  i also get very, very sleepy. almost all day i could drop into a nap and be asleep within minutes.  this is all very annoying, but i am most bothered by my neurological head symptoms. has anyone ever had neurological symptoms get better with thyroid treatment?  i know one dear lady on here has been helped, but i was looking for more encouragement! thanks!!^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"no droid1226, i haven't.  i have had dr's tell me to take it when i felt anxious, but my anxiety (if that is even what it is) comes in short burst, i don't feel like its worth doping me up on and getting addicted to it!  when i would get feelings like i could ""spazz"" or ""seizure, and the head sensations get out of hand... i would take it just so i could endure it better, but it never helped with symptoms."^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"- foxy lady,  most seizure drugs are depressant in nature. however, adding an ssri could boomerang in a very harsh way. even without other brain chemical altering drugs on board as with the seizure drug, ssri can really mess with brain chemistry of those with health challenges in ways you don't see in the happy commercials.  ssris can lower the seizure threshold, too, so you could be having more instances of seizure activity.  [editing after re-reading your posts:  you've not been diagnosed with a seizure disorder. i'm not sure such a strong drug was prescribed for you but that, itself, could be causing some of the symptoms.  for the seizure drug you just started for some reason other than it's intended use: (wiki reports)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lamotrigine  excerpts:  . . . black box warning . . . never suddenly stop this drug . . . .  . . .

[end excerpts]   - that drowsiness can turn to depression for many and any dizziness can, too - especially for someone with lyme.  so, be sure to read up on all the ways this can affect you. and, you say you are not treating lyme now with rx, but with mhbot . . . still, be sure a ll doctor assess all meds for how they can affect you. other doctors will not have the knowledge on this matter.  what is your dose and type of magnesium? that should be addressed first, really. see the seizure thread above for more detail.  there are other ways to address mood issues, especially as many seizure drugs are stress to liver / kidneys (and that can cause depression) be sure your liver / kidney support is in tip top form. still, as you've not been diagnosed with a seizure disorder, please reassess this use.  ldn can have some side effects, too. some do great with it, while some seem to have a terrible time.  assess all rx you take as to how they might be contributing to symptoms. if you feel better with each, great. but it just sounds like something is out of balance for you to say you are feeling so severe.  cortisol ? hmmm. hope you mean a physiological replacement dose and not higher.  be sure your llmd is aware of this, too.  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=119975;p=0  cortef ?  discussing the very low, safe physiological replacement dose range of hydrocortisone for some with adrenal dysfunction.   http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/1/100984?""""000000  topic: what do steroids actually do to those with lyme? risks, long term damage discussed. links. -  [ 05-06-2016, 02:34 pm: message edited by: keebler ]"^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
here's a completely different take on it...just something to consider. i was having this issue. i felt weird in the morning...kind of uncomfortable and a bit anxious due to how my stomach felt.  then i would get up and have diarrhea. sometimes i would have to go twice urgently. i used to have what i call normal ibs symptoms since i've been sick with lyme but this has now gone further.  i can't believe you posted this and are having this problem because i just wrote about this under earthing and grounding subject! i had the diarrhea for about 5 months and then had a colonoscopy and endoscopy about a month ago. they found some irritation but it was mostly normal.  i had asked for biopsies to be done for h pylori and histamine activation syndrome. i think the test was cd117. the results were that i had lymphocytic colitis....which basically just means inflammation that only shows on microscopic examination.  it does not lead to cancer and can be caused by infection, drugs,,,and i can't remember what else. the doc had me take 14 days of peptobismal because it contains bismuth and this is supposed to treat h-pylori (even tho they couldn't find it on the biopsy). bismuth has also been found to treat gastro lyme.  well the pepto didn't do anything till there was three days left of treatment and then i improved. but....i had also taken antihistamines those last three days.so....i am not sure what worked. histamine intolerance can cause your symptoms and mine. check out the earthing and grounding post for the rest of the story.  i had to have my husband come home from work today because i was so dizzy, nauseous, and chills with shakes. took a doxy and an antihistamine and temp is now 97 instead of 96 and i feel better. not sure what did it . check out histamine intolerance.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

doc told me viral biotoxins really cause hepatic stress.  i'm not using the right lingo here, but basically, same thing with me. super nauseated, not able to vomit, almost become faint, then get crazy diarrhea and feel better.  like a hangover every morning but without the booze as a cause.  overburdened liver is what i was told was the cause of this for me.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i checked with my chiropractor today and he said if the atlas vertebra - c1 - is subluxated, that can cause dizziness. if c2 is subluxated, that can cause nausea.  and lyme patients, in particular, can have spinal problems since lyme attacks the joints, soft tissues and nerves.  any chiropractor we see needs to be really good at checking and adjusting the neck. this cannot be done by someone who doesn't know what they're doing.  believe you me, i've been through a lot of the latter kind, and now only see chiros who are great at upper cervical adjusting.  if it has anything to do with the neck, the relief happens very quickly.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i don't know.  ativan is very addictive, so keep those levels low. once you get hooked on it, your body will be asking for more and more of it for the same effect.  ask your doctor to find the cause of the nausea, that's for sure.  --------------------  oops! --lymetutu-- opinions, not medical advice!^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
not sure about the coconut oil but there is a very bad cold/flu going around. i had it for a couple of weeks. it goes away & then comes back...  i've had this bone crushing fatigue feeling during this cold. i had cfs awhile ago. i know what it feels like. this flu/cold feels similar. also, extreme pain in the neck & back like i was kicked by a horse. it is passing but it takes a while.  i know a few people who have had this cold.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
from googling around, it sounds like it's more cns-related vertigo than positional. in cns cases, doctors would want to go down the road of running the tests and tests and tests that i had when trying to identify the source of my migraines (nothing was found, cuz surprise! it's lyme.) and trying all of the meds i tried for my migraines which didn't work.  i have no desire/intention to run that gamut again. no point in spending that kind of money for nothing except a big annoyance. and the treatment for one of the conditions they look for is 2 years of steroids. yeah...no.  the vertigo is better when i lie down, and seems to be related more to moving my eyes than moving my head. concurrent with the new symptom of vertigo is phonophobia, something i haven't had a problem with for the last 1-1/2+ years that i've had migraines. that also indicates cns vs. bppv.  the aphasia i have (which just keeps getting worse, of course) would thrill the doctors at first (a mystery to solve!) until the mystery couldn't be solved. again, no point/desire to go down that road. (the aphasia also suggests that cns is more likely than pbbv.)  frustrated to be in a position of depending on other people to drive me around again. i hope the vertigo is a short-lived problem.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

- handy, right in my file notes:  ginger capsules can help relieve nausea and dizziness. but it needs to be kept up at a therapeutic dose that only the capsules seem to provide. although the tea can help a bit.  take ginger capsules a couple hours away from rx. it has some antioxidant properties and it may speed rx through too fast if taken at the same time.  http://oneearthherbs.squarespace.com/important-herbs/ginger-rootrhizome-zingiber-officinalis.html  ginger   there are some homeopathic sublingual pellets, too, that can ease discomfort instantly (great for flying).  abchomeopathy.com/r.php/tab  tabacum   http://abchomeopathy.com/r.php/cocc  cocculus -^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

back in december 2015 i got the chills, nausea and a migraine for 2 days. in the next week i had joint pain. doc gave me steroids and pain killers and told me i had a virus.  a week later doc called back to tell me my lyme test game back positive. when trying to get an id appt, most docs didn't take me because my results weren't actually positive according to cdc. i needed up getting 2 weeks of doxy anyways.  6 months later: still experiencing symptoms of what i believe to be lyme, but sometimes i question if i'm just being crazy. i got tested again and the elisa came back negative. i am tired all the time, headaches all the time, occasional momentary pain randomly in my body, mostly on the right side.  this week out of no where i've had a constant neck ache, and a crick in my neck. i got adjusted and no relief. my knee is also hurting right in the middle of my knee- no swelling. often times i feel very jittery- as if i had too much coffee.  i saw an llmd last week and am back on doxy, and i am waiting for my test results from igenex and about 100 other tests.  mentally and emotionally, it's very difficult. i'm 23 and single, and this is very expensive and emotionally trying. what if i don't have lyme and it's just all random and not serious?  ***if anyone has had a similar experience- i'd love your feedback.  ***** can anyone legitimize my neck or knee symptoms? how do i determine if the neck pain is a lyme symtom and not a normal neck thing like normal people? any tips on relief for neck pain and knee pain? i'm already regularly taking advil for headaches.^0^1^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"- seizures  that's a whole other chapter. also somewhat common to lyme . . . and far too common in my life. what has most with lyme & seizures is to treat lyme assertively with key liver support on board. also key help:  avoid all food additives & artificial sweeteners  sleep, rest as needed. because she deals with insomnia (another key symptom), that can be especially rough. if she can start to sense a seizure coming on,  rather than trying to ""talk herself out of it"" as seems the trudge on way many might think, get to a place to rest the very instant that thought even crosses the mind.  mine are always triggered by some sensory ""thing"" and if hers might be, too, i can elaborate on some tricks but this can be rather isolating and that's really hard on anyone's spirit.  so to explain and to let you know this need not be a forever condition, i've never had access to proper treatment, though have learned how to best manage within my means. with some key advice from your lyme support groups, i so hope she can get proper assessment / treatment for whatever all is going on.  it is possible, entirely possible, for her life to turn around, though it may take a couple years.  adrenal stress is also very much a part of this and that goes with lyme, too.  avoid getting overheated - the very instant that feeling hits, get cooled down, this is vital  magnesium,  a gluten free diet,  avoid fluorescent lights & flashes  food / glucose stability helps  i have a couple links set for the vestibular issues (dizziness, hyperacusis, vertigo) and also for seizures but you have the key helpers here for now so i'll back off).  my very best to you both / whole family. -"^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"if you have intestinal parasites, and many do, that could explain why the stomach ailments are so bad. flagyl kills these parasites and many other types also. it kills many, many things.  as i said in another thread, when i took flagyl for lyme, it was not a bad herx at all (4 days of feeling bad and 3 of feeling half bad).  but, when i took flagyl for c. diff, that really took me to the limit. everything you are describing. so, as you can see, when i had an intestinal issue and was prescribed flagyl, that was a whole different matter. a friend without lyme had the same experience.  it is really up to you if you want to take a day or 2 off. i hope you are doing all the detox methods you know how to do. that really is the key to keeping these ""side effects"" down. they are generally detox side effects, so that is why you need to detox like mad."^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"would love peoples' experiences. a few months ago i started getting chest pain and light headedness after exercise. yes, of course this could be a heart problem and i know lyme affects the heart. but there are some weird characteristics of it:  1) the pain is on the left side, about 3"" below my nipple (i'm male). it seems too low to be heart. the pain sometimes goes even lower and more to the left. on an anatomy diagram it is exactly where the spleen is.  2) the pain comes on after exercise, not during. i think heart stuff is mostly during.  3) i have in fact been experiencing a creeping worsening of babesia over the past months, and i know babesia can cause spleen pain/enlargement. but would it cause this *after exercise* specifically?  4) my ekg results have been normal, but i haven't done a stress ekg or exercise testing, only at rest.  just wondering if anyone can shed light on this... specifically, spleen pain and light headedness *after* exercise. it may be a heart problem but i'm just not thinking that it is. unsure. thanks."^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0
from what i understand, chronic pancreatitis persists for several years befor it is diagnosed.  it typically causes severe immobilizing pain, especially after eating, so much so that people often stop eating. it also causes diarrhea (a certain type called steatorrhea) and weight loss.  there are specific tests that can detect chronic pacreatitis. your doctor will be aware of these but if you are concerned, it might be best to get a referral to see a gastroenterologist.  you will need lots of labs including your pancreatic enzymes. in acute pancreatitis the levels will be high. in chronic cases, they will still be mildly elevated. only the most extremely late cases where the pancreas has suffered atrophy and fibrosis will the levels appear normal to low.  that is why you cannot diagnose bases on labs alone when you have symptoms!  you may also choose to have an mrcp (mri based test) or an ercp (endoscopy type test) both of these tests are used to directly closely at the pancreas and gallbladder.  benifits of ercp is that the physician can do procedures like remove stones from ducts and place stents when needed. mrcp only allows for visualization.  eus is a type of ultrasound that can also be used to visualize the pancreas and gallbladder area too. this is done through an extended endoscopy.  so basically you need to find out if you have pancreatitis and why, what is causing it. when you know why, that is how they will treat you.  if you have a stone blocking a duct, they remove it. if you have a narrow duct, they open it. whatever is going on, they will discuss your options so that you can make an informed decision.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

look at pages 23 and 26 of burrascano. your vague dizziness and headache are likely babesiosis symptoms.  nearly everyone with lyme also has babesiosis.  headache is also extremely common with lyme disease itself, even if you don't have brain fog. i think i had a headache for months prior to my diagnosis.  people told me i looked great also. meanwhile, i felt so sick that i believed i really should have been hospitalized.  i wonder if perhaps you have not studied the burrascano guidelines enough even though you have been on lymenet since 2008. i strongly suggest you virtually memorize them.  the more you educate yourself about this disease and the coinfections and their symptoms, the more calm you will be about what is happening to you. you will know that it is all par for the course.  look at the list on page 10 where vertigo and spinning and motion sickness are all listed as symptoms.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
i'm almost 100%, around 80%... but get some fatigue spells here and there even though i can run 2-3 miles, play sports, and bench press 225 like 7 times.  would be nice to get up to 300 pounds bench press 3-4 times like my old self, but i'm working at it...  so i decided to try a coconut oil detox, well aware of how monolaurin is supposedly a biofilm buster and coconut oil in general is antibacterial, antifungal, etc... very skeptic of it being a cure, i took it just to try a detox with other things.  i highly doubt this fatigue feeling is a herx... honestly i never got bad herxes that everyone talks about, my reactions of antibiotics were always just dizziness and muscle twitches. point i'm making is just be aware of the side effects from the stuff, it's been published numerous articles how a coconut oil detox can cause some serious symptoms even if you don't have lyme.  just be careful, i'm almost 100% and haven't felt this crappy in a long time, years!!! going on 4th day since i took the stuff, did a hot bath detox still feeling pretty lethargic.  can't imagine how coconut oil would make a sick lyme person feel. just be aware that coconut oil is very thick, it could possibly make you blood very thick as well, which in return cause some serious fatigue when you take it.  and i'm not talking about cooking with it or just a teaspoon a day, that's fine. i did a detox which was up to 10 times in one day...^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0
i have interstitial cystitis. mine mostly feels like an infection when there isn't one. it was one of my first symptoms and was bad for awhile but got to where it would only flare up once or twice a year which i would drink a ton of water and i took levsin (hyoscyamine sulfate) which would help with pain and spasms. it came back on a regular basis about 4 years ago after a really bad uti and taking pepcid (famotidine) which is an h2 blocker has worked miracles for the pain which was my main issue. i'm not sure if this is what's bothering you. i also have to avoid acidic drinks, including lemon water unfortunately because they are a huge trigger. i only drink water, green tea which i can handle a little lime and almond milk in smoothies. hope you can figure it out.  -------------------- ill since 1998 dx 2005^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

hi there i'm a 30 year old women who recently started feeling all wrong.  it all started after i came home from our hunting cabin in the mountains. first symptoms where i was hanging laundry and my heart started to race, got dizzy and the urge to go to the bathroom all at once.  i made it upstairs and has to sit on our cold floor to keep from falling because my legs went weak and started to tingle. then i got really hot but started shivering uncontrolled.  once at the hospital it slowly went away but my stomach felt horrible. now before i go on i have never had stomach issues before.  since then i have been to the hospital 4 times, had flu like symptoms then got diagnosed with pneumonia.  i have head aches, stiff neck, muscle and joint pain, stomach and bowel issues , constant dizziness, fatigue, low fever, depressed feeling (i will cry for dumb reasons ),  blurred vision, sensitive to light and sound, and i'm losing way to much weight i now weigh 89 lbs which is 17 lbs less than before this started.  please i need to know if lyme is a possibility since none of my doctor's have bothered to check but one brought it up.

tulips, i had the same experience with crypto, burning cold feet/lower legs.  it cause numbness and tingling and weird shooting pains and i had been on it for months (it works really well for bab!) before i figured out what was going on.  i was scared of these symptoms but as soon as i stopped the crypto these feelings stopped. i can bring it all back with even a couple drops of crypto.  i think it is so important not to underestimate side effects/adverse reactions to herbs and pharm drugs...  my doc had never heard of anything like my reaction to it but it seems that you had a similar experience..^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
it has been a while since posting but i could really use some advice from those who have been through this.  my background is a tick bite in 2009 which developed to late stage that same year. through a lot of lifestyle changes, i beat it and was well again and off abx by 2012. no issues since then until recently.  earlier this year, i showed lyme symptoms and tested positive through igenex. my llmd put me on a six month regiment of abx and i responded well immediately. i felt fine until september and that is when the fun began.  i should add that i got complacent with diet and lifestyle during the last six months so lesson learned.  during the month of september, i went from my normal active self (even while on biaxin) to severe dizziness, weakness, exhaustion, head pressure, headaches, neck pain, brain fog, etc.  it turns out that i have a systemic candida condition and currently on diflucan and nystatin. treatment started three weeks ago and have been religiously avoiding all sugar and carbs (lost ten pounds in that time).  i have also been supplementing with sf22, caprylic acid, oregano oil, coconut oil, pau d'arco tea, and probiotics. i still take plenty of other supplements for the lyme. detox consists of bentonite, colonix, and hot baths / showers.  i have shown improvement over the past three weeks but the herx reactions are not as brutal. hopefully, i am doing what i need to do but i have a few questions:  1) this candida wrecked me physically during the course of only one month which amazed my llmd and he had no explanation. has anyone on these forums been impacted this fast by candida? if so, please share experience.  2) a friend recommended a colonic but am not sure. yes / no / thoughts?  3) next llmd appointment is on 12/26. has anyone taken abx and anti-candida meds at same time (provided i keep showing improvement)?  4) if you were in this situation and got better, how long did it take you?  5) should i be doing anything different to increase my odds of crushing this candida?  any advice would greatly be appreciated.

i was having unbearable brain fog, exhaustion and depression during and after my last round of tetracycline and rifampin. when i stopped these i was still gone.  it's a little less than four weeks later and i happened to get a bottle of gabamax gabatrol powder in the mail. i started taking it to replace benzos since i'd been cut off.  lo and behold after taking it three times a day after one day my brain kicked right on.  drugs killing infections. messes with neurotransmitters. brain does not switch back after a bunch of microglia blow up.  rebalance neurotransmitters.  profit.  i am not sure if increasing gaba would work for you because i have no idea if that's what ultimately happened. neurotransmitters are dependent on other neurotransmitters so the gaba could have just flipped a switch that normalized something else.  but it might be worth it to experiment.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

if it causes only first or second degree av heart block, you would not experience any symptoms. it would be an incidental finding on a routine ekg.  if you had third degree heart block, it might cause fatigue, dizziness, episodes of blacking out, some chest pain, & shortness of breath. usually these symptoms are noticeable enough that they prompt you to see a physician for evaluation.  so if you are concerned at all about your symptoms, you should see a cardiologist for an evaluation. they can further evaluate you and truly diagnose what is going and find out what that means for you.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i am being treated for my 2nd round of lyme (1st round 11 years ago.)  this time is quite like last time, once i started treatment, i have been improving rapidly.  i don't even have night sweats anymore, i just realized. haven't twitched in a week. no swelling or joint pain (that was bad a month ago.)  i am to take my abx (doxy, ceftin, and a sulfa) through christmas.i am doing a cyst buster herb. we decided not to do dapsone because i got so much better so quickly.  our deductible has been met this year, way! and it's $10000, so we are trying to get everything in. i was planning on a bunionectomy, but put it off when i got sick with lyme. now i am thinking i can do it by dec. 31. lord knows they won't have to give me any extra antibiotics, and i hate the thought of going on them again later just for surgery.  what do you think? i know you are not doctors. just wondering what your opinions are. i feel great, though!^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

you have active lyme symptoms. this is not die off. i say this because i live in the world you describe. 1. dizziness and vertigo - i went to the cleveland clinic because my dizziness was so debilitating. i couldn't even stand while showering. no success. went to physical therapy. no success. medications, no success.  2. brain fog - some days i'm good, some days not.  3. splititing headache over right eye. i had reiki and it worked. i'm a believer. no more headache pain !  4. zoned out ? you betcha... i now lose time. i keep track of minutes lost. 40 minutes is the most time i somehow misplaced.  i was first treated for chronic neuro lyme (undiagnosied 3 years) with a 28 day doxy. it was like night and day. i smiled for the first time in over 6 months. my skin was smooth and glowing. had a twinkle in my eye. had energy and smart !  when antibiotics were gone, so was my cure. now my spinal cord is non stop vibrating,constant vertigo and dizziness,wide spread pain,feeling like bugs are crawling on my legs,seeing shadows.real neuro stuff.  if i had to go by my experiences, i wouldn't think it's a die off but a condition that hasn't been addressed.  i am constantly learning new things. i think you might be interested in a new therapy i just read about. it's a new medication called ibudilast. it somehow decreases viruses in the vagus nerve. many mention it to your llmd.  good luck, my friend^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"so i was desperate adn googled this: ""pian in head when i sit""  and i got a lot of answers actually! and a discussion was giong on with all these people that have the same sx as i do- pain all over but in head mostly, and sitting makes it worse and other things... (see list at end of all the sx)  so- since all these sx are so like lyme.  has anyone here been misdiagnosed with lyme or chiari? or do you have both?  i'm getting worried as this ""new"" pain gets worse and worse. i cannot stand it. and i guess chiari can come from having lyme. i have al the sx below except for curved spine. <sigh> so tired of al this  from the website:  listed below are chiari symptoms grouped by the body area affected:  headache  • pressure-like headaches that start at the back of the skull and may radiate behind the eyes. • headaches that worsen with physical strain, coughing, sneezing, or bending forward (chiari headaches are often mistaken for migraines)  pain / spine problems  • neck pain, pain across shoulder blades • chest pain • general body pain • curvature of the spine (scoliosis) may be present with syringomyelia • joint hypermobility (ehler-danlos syndrome) • tethered cord  balance / ear problems  • ringing or buzzing in the ear (tinnitus) • dizziness, spinning (vertigo) • imbalance, clumsiness • trouble walking (gait) • hearing loss  eye problems  • blurred or double vision • sensitivity to bright light • spots or floaters in your vision • jerking eye movements (nystagmus) • difficulty tracking or following objects with your eyes  sleep problems  • snoring • sleep apnea • fatigue • inability to fall or stay asleep (insomnia)  face and throat problems  • difficulty swallowing, choking and gagging • facial pain, numbness or tingling • hoarseness, change in voice • chronic cough  problems in arms and legs (spinal cord signs)  • numbness or tingling in arms / hands / legs • weakness in arms / hands / legs • poor hand coordination • loss of feeling in arms / hands • general body weakness  thinking (cognitive) problems  • trouble speaking, word finding • trouble thinking • problems with memory and concentration • depression or mood changes • nervousness or anxiety  other problems  • nausea and vomiting • abdominal pain • frequent urination • irregular heart beat, palpitations • passing out episodes, syncope  chiari is often misdiagnosed because of the variety of bony and soft tissue abnormalities that compress the spinal cord, brainstem, cranial nerves, or blood vessels, resulting in a wide array of possible symptoms.  in fact, the diagnosis is often delayed until symptoms become severe or persistent. however, accurate diagnosis and an effective treatment plan are important to prevent further injury to the person’s nervous system.  above info came from here: http://www.mayfieldchiaricenter.com/chiari_symptoms.php  -------------------- ""the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits."""^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
minocycline can cause some unpleasant nervous system side effects. lots of dizziness, unsteadiness, and just weird feeling. you get those because it's penetrating into the brain so well. he might need to ease into that one to get used to it.  flagyl can cause neuropathy, so watch out for nerve pain on that one. if he gets that he might need to take b12 or maybe even stop the flagyl. and of course watch out for severe herxing.  they don't usually put doxy and mino together, but i have seen people on both of them a time or two.  good luck to him with this new combo!^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

the combo of head pressure and crippling stomach pain and nausea describes my last few months - here's what my doc said/did (not necessarily the same for you of course):  (1) stool testing revealed low secretory iga - which messes with immune function. have since been put on a mushroom blend for gut and immune health and colostrum.  after about a week of those, my stomach pain (and nausea!) has disappeared! (this is after an ultrasound, ct, etc....lots of tests.)  (2) i'm transitioning to gluten-free, and when i do accidentally have gluten my stomach hurts a bit.  (3) i complained about congestions and head pressure particularly when lying down, and my llmd did a nasal culture. this revealed marcons (a resistant staph infection in my upper sinuses).  i haven't started the nasal spray for this yet, but it's good to have an explanation,  that said, this chiari stuff is interesting because i've had headaches like those for long time so i will check that out. i hope you find relief soon.^0^1^1^1^0^0^0^1^0^0^0
lisa, my daughter was having a lot of head aches. so her pediatrician (she was only about 12 at the time) recommended she see a neurologist. the chiari malformation showed up through an mri of the brain that the neurologist ordered.  the neurologist did not think it severe enough to do surgery to correct. instead she recommended no shaking or jerking amusement park rides and if she ever gets in any type of accident, to make sure brain mri is taken.  this was many years ago and since that time, the head aches have lessened. my daughter has taken up running and now runs marathons. so she has a pretty normal life despite having this condition.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"fuji, see this post from carol from pa:  ""when antibiotics kill lyme bacteria, the liver uses more magnesium to detoxify the poisons left behind. so you may become deficient in magnesium.  magnesium deficiency can cause palpitations and other heart irregularities.  are you having other problems like anxiety, depression, insomnia, muscle twitching or spasms, sensitivity to light or sound? these are all symptoms of low magnesium.""  http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=135746;p=0""""000014  so, this is another possible cause of your panic attacks and adrenal problems. you can easily add magnesium to your protocol, and i suggest you do so.  mag is very important for all lyme patients to take. it takes about a week (or less) for it to get rid of the symptoms of low mag. however, this assumes you are on a very good, very absorbable magnesium such as magtab sr recommended by burrascano.  this mag is truly superior to what you will buy in most health food stores. most mag on store shelves is not absorbed or is very poorly absorbed. if you are not a magnesium expert, then i suggest you order magtab sr online today and start taking the burrascano suggested dose:  ""6. magnesium (required) magnesium supplementation is very helpful for the tremors, twitches, cramps, muscle soreness, heart skips and weakness. it may also help in energy level and cognition. the best source is magnesium l-lactate dehydrate (“mag-tab sr”, sold by niche pharmaceuticals: 1-800-677-0355, and available at wal-mart). do not rely on “cal-mag”, calcium plus magnesium combination tablets, as they are not well absorbed. take at least one tablet twice daily. higher doses increase the benefit and should be tried, but may cause diarrhea. in some cases, intramuscular or intravenous doses may be necessary.""

"if it were me, i would try taking lots and lots of magnesium to see if that did the trick. it is a quick and easy test.  usually, if it is mag deficiency, you will notice improvement in a few days.  this is the most common reason for a lyme patient to have muscle knots.  here is what burrascano says:  ""magnesium deficiency is very often present and quite severe. hyperreflexia, muscle twitches, myocardial irritability, poor stamina and recurrent tight muscle spasms are clues to this deficiency.  magnesium is predominantly an intracellular ion, so blood level testing is of little value.  oral preparations are acceptable for maintenance, but those with severe deficiencies need additional, parenteral dosing: 1 gram iv or im at least once a week until neuromuscular irritability has cleared. (page 6)  (required) magnesium supplementation is very helpful for the tremors, twitches, cramps, muscle soreness, heart skips and weakness. it may also help in energy level and cognition.  the best source is magnesium l-lactate dehydrate (�mag-tab sr�, sold by niche pharmaceuticals: 1-800-677-0355, and available at wal-mart).  do not rely on �cal-mag�, calcium plus magnesium combination tablets, as they are not well absorbed. take at least one tablet twice daily.  higher doses increase the benefit and should be tried, but may cause diarrhea. in some cases, intramuscular or intravenous doses may be necessary."" (page 28)  http://www.ilads.org/lyme_disease/b_guidelines_12_17_08.pdf  i've seen it work over and over in all the years i have been on this board. some have had total tight muscles for a very long time. it was mag deficiency the entire time.  spread the doses of mag out throughout the day. otherwise, you can get diarrhea.  i really hope this helps you. so sorry you have had to suffer this.  please post and tell us if it worked!

hello fellow canadian neighbor to the north  i got bite in western new york and my county tested 80% with borrella bourgdefori, mylamtoi, and bartonella.  finally i got llmd and started treatment for neurolyme. i have been treating for 2 months. haven't worked for 7 months. i went the herbal route first but got worse.  it's been really slow in progress. but a lot of the scary, crazy neuro symptoms have diminished . seeing things, hearing things, face and arms and legs paralyzed, bugs crawling, body in constant vibrating mode,constant spasms and shakes and twitches are gone.  i'm still struggling and feel like i m dying. chronic vertigo, dizziness,fatigue,pain, crying jags, depersonalizations,blurry vision,brain fog,eye pain, headaches,drop things, fall down,tinnitis,sleep problems, and others.  i gave you everything as per my experience. i hope it helps. we re all in this together my friend.^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
"fuji, you will see panic attacks listed by burrascano as a lyme symptom. see p. 9:  ""anxiety, panic attacks""  lyme anxiety is a very common lyme symptom. i had it for years and had to go on medication for it. it is a terrible symptom. nearly everyone with lyme gets it.  also the adrenal malfunction. so, whatever bodily system lyme attacks, that system will malfunction. that is what is happening to you unless you have worked yourself up into such a state that your state of mind about getting sick from lyme/having to take antibiotics is causing this.  whatever the cause, if it continues and you can't get rid of it on your own, a lyme doctor will prescribe something for it. suffering from anxiety is no way to live."^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0
welcome nnj!  i had the twitching too, even eye lid which was so annoying. twitching and some spasms can be from lyme (looks like you have it) but those herbs are primarily for parasites so they are likely the cause. parasites are a huge issue for lyme patients and very often over looked. there is one well known lyme doc who treats all of his patients for parasites first.  good for you for starting treatment your own. you might also look into stephen harrod buhner's books on lyme and co infections. he is the master of herbs for lyme and company. lyme typically comes with co infections that must be addressed as well.  another thing to consider is that lyme patients are typically low in minerals. a magnesium deficiency could cause twitching as well. you might try some mag. also selenium and zinc are usually low for lyme patients.  https://www.amazon.com/healing-lyme-prevention-borreliosis-coinfections/dp/0970869630/ref=sr_1_2?ie=utf8&qid=1485977397&sr=8-2&keywords=healing+lyme  -------------------- --keep an open mind about everything. also, remember to visit activism (we can change things together).^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

"hello everyone,  some of you have been following my journey since i got a puncture wound in september, which gave me a mild case of tetanus and re-activated my babesia. i'm here to post an update for you. i also posted this update on the mild hyperbaric thread, here: http://flash.lymenet.org/scripts/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/1/125201/23?""""001732 - since most of my questions at this point relate to hyperbarics.  i wanted to also post the update on a separate thread, though, because i don't want to hijack the mild hyperbaric thread. if you want to respond to me about my issue in relation to hyperbarics, please use the above-linked thread.  if you want to respond to me with information unrelated to mild hyperbaric, please do so on this thread here.  thanks for your help and i'm happy to ""see"" all of you again!  bryan rosner  ________________  update feb 26 2017  hello everyone!  i've been lurking here for a few weeks now.  some of you may have read of my recent troubles. i had been feeling very good for a number of years until a puncture wound on my foot in september. this wound gave me what i believe to be a mild case of tetanus. i began to have muscle spasms and tightness for the first time in my life, almost immediately after the wound. i was in and out of the hospital several times last year.  the trauma also caused my babesia to flare. i hadn't had symptoms of babesia for years. air hunger, hot flashes, headaches, fatigue. the symptoms were immediately recognizable to me as babesia. i had long battled babesia back in the early 2000's.  fast forward to today. while i seem to have improved and stabilized a bit, i'm still not out of the woods. my foot still hurts and burns like crazy, right where the wound is, and in surrounding tissue. i've even noticed that the hurting and burning has gone up my ankle and into my leg a bit, which is terribly scary. however, all of my tests for osteomylitis and other serious infections have so far come back negative. plus, tetanus isn't a highly invasive bacteria, so it wouldn't make sense that tetanus is causing this.  so, knowing that tetanus is averse to oxygen, i have been using a prescription to obtain medical grade tanks of oxygen and using a mask i have been breathing oxygen periodically, about once every day or every other day for a period of 20-40 minutes.  this is where you guys come in. i need your help!  there's no question that breathing this oxygen has helped me. but it has also seemingly made the babesia symptoms considerably worse - air hunger, shortness of breath, hot flashes, fatigue, etc.  so on the one hand it is helping me but on the other hand it is hurting me.  i don't want to get into the whole debate about hboc flaring babesia. i've read a few people on this thread who say it has flared their babesia, and a few people who say it hasn't. do we really know for sure? i don't think we know for sure.  phoiph has been kind enough to call me and speak with me. i believe her hypothesis that we need to get the immune system back online, instead of chase bugs, is a very valid approach.  one strange thing that has been happening to me is that breathing the oxygen has made the pain in my foot and lower leg worse, not better. this leads me to think that whatever is in my leg, is babesia perhaps!? why else would it get worse? unless the oxygen is increasing inflammation and causing my body to fight more?  i'm considering getting a chamber because as i mentioned, the breathing of oxygen has helped me in some ways. but i'm also worried that it has seemed to make babesia symptoms worse, and also has made the pain in my leg and foot worse.  would love any input or ideas. i've tried a ton of things since september, already, but i'm open to new ideas, especially new analysis of what the heck is going on in my body, if anyone has any guesses!  thanks in advance for your help and ideas.  sincerely,  bryan rosner"^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i've been trying for a decade to fix the hpu problem, without success.  my daughter and i have the problem (one lab test done long ago). we never could supplement zinc, due to excessive reactions.  when we go back to see the lyme doctor (we no longer have lyme, so we go see him every other year.... or less), he always tests us back and find hpu issue.  my daughter was the picture of the pyroluria children: white face, broken nails, many infections...  she got better after using the violet ray (no more white face, for sure, her nails grow better, not perfect but better, but she still catches infections if she's on gluten).  whatever this is, we both react like hell to zinc.  so now we are trying another varied version of the kpu, with imprinted zinc. for the first time ever, i could pass one week on daily intake of zinc, without a collapse.  i had pain, fatigue, headaches, tummy aches, but have not totally collapsed. yet!!  my daughter too. we're crossing fingers our bodies will stop dumping zinc like it always did...  dr. k continues to preach about hpu, he thinks it's still important, after so many years. so he continues to find the problem in his patients, probably.^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

i also agree that what was written is hurtful and wrong. i wish dr.'s would get this figured out and sooner than later.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
i agree with tf. every primary care appointment i've had over the last several years has those statements on the discharge papers.  i'm pretty sure it's just wording they are taught.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
good to know, bonnie!  only mds are not yet convinced.  there must be a kipping point. it can't go on like that any longer!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1

kerry, just click on the paper and pencil icon above your post. that will allow you to edit your post any way you like. so, that is how you can eliminate your email address.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
thanks for sharing this!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1

sadly, nothing on the net is private. the biggest black mark against the current presidential cabinet is their difference in allowing private enterprise to monitor you and your computer activities as a demographic. your taxes goes towards 70-billion dollar national security apparatus that supports 16 different agencies dedicated... to spy on you. did you ever 'register' your phone number to facilitate an e-mail 'i.d.'? did you donate blood, and give them your e-mail (which they must verify and store for 50 years)? you're on the grid; get use to it, or complain to your representatives... -and really get on the grid!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
thanks for sharing these tips.  -------------------- gloriaphair^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
i googled my name and what do you know? up popped stuff i had posted in open groups and instructor pages on facebook!!!!! so beware if you are posting in a lyme support group that isn't private.^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
i used my real name in a private message. was that wrong to do?^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
the only ones who will see your email address are the moderators when you report a post.  -------------------- sixgoofykids.blogspot.com^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
should we be concerned about having our email address here? thanks a lot ann^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
i would love to change mine. haven't quite been able to do this so far, so maybe i should re-register? not sure what to do about this.  jl^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
"thanks for the warning, keebler, don't worry, ""burgess"" is not part of my real name."^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
- ian,  i would not be as concerned since there is no last name or initial but you can change your location anytime by editing your profile.  you might try to re-register and see if the system will let you but it may let only one registration per computer^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
yeah, a first name is not quite so bad. you can always pass it off as your dog's name!!  no offense meant... ian is a very nice person name!!  --------------------  oops! --lymetutu-- opinions, not medical advice!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
and i would also suggest not posting your email address as your screen name!!!!  both of the above scare me to death! thanks for posting this, keebler!! it's really been bothering me. i get worried about these folks!  --------------------  oops! --lymetutu-- opinions, not medical advice!^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1
that's what i use.  you must have an incredible memory keebler. i have forgot most of the resources you post although i have read it in the past.  dan^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1

"as i am re-reading the study with more time and thought (and absorption) i want to clarify my comment where i said above- quote- ""(18 patient study)"".  i should have explained this better at the time, but was in a hurry to write it all up and get it out to various places.  the ""18"" patients reference- in brackets- was specifically noted by me to emphasis the fact that out of those 18 people with adverse reactions, four died.  for this study many hospital records (2,205 admissions to a leprosy treatment facility) were reviewed.  then, 18 people who were on dapsone and other meds had the adverse reactions and were specifically described in detail for this study.  in other words, not everyone who ever took dapsone had these reactions, but for the ones who did- it was severe and even deadly in some cases.  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````  another comment that i found interesting was....  quote- after authors reviewed another separate study-  ""lymphadenopathy due to dapsone was found to be 34.9% in leprosy patients. in the same study, seven patients died, with a death rate of 11.1% due to dapsone hypersensitivity.  in our study, out of 18 patients, four patients died due to dapsone adrs, three patients were cured and some were still on treatment.  out of four patients who died, two expired due to severe anemia and two others expired due to jaundice and severe dapsone syndrome.""  ``````````````````````````````````  now i want to go back and re-read for a 3rd time- tomorrow when i am ""fresh""- and do some more research to see if this could have possibly been part of an unrecognized herxheimer reaction?  just a wild thought, but wanting to see if that is at all possible. not even sure if herxheimers are described in the literature for leprosy patients, so it will take some time to put the pieces together.  -------------------- www.treatthebite.com www.drjoneskids.org www.marylandlyme.org www.lymedoc.org"^0^1^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0

i have done several parasite cleanses like paragone and humaworm and oil of oregano, but they did nothing for me. not during the treatment or after the treatment.  i would like to see dr. k in seattle but i am not sure i can afford it.^0^1^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0
i am so sorry to hear this. one of my very best friends, who i actually met right here on lymenet about 10 years ago, died one year ago almost to the day from triple negative breast cancer, stage 1, no nodes.  she was merrygirl here for those who remember melissa. she obviously had chronic lyme for years before the cancer diagnosis. i don't really think there is a definitive connection; a large number of people get cancer at some point in their lives, lyme or not. however there certainly are arguments to be made.  i hope you do well and that the chemo won't be too hard on you!!!! xo  -------------------- no pm; contact: tracywill9@yahoo.com  13 years lyme & co.; small fiber neuropathy; myasthenia gravis, adrenal insufficiency. on chemo for 2 1/2 years as experimental treatment for mg.^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0
"nb day """"15. i feel like death today, nobody should ever go through this. testicle pain, sick stomach, more pain and horrible activity in the worst place. flu symptoms and my chest is heavy with a runny nose. drove to the best health food store and bought oil of oregano, more cat's claw, more milk thistle, and an andrographis antiviral blend. got a $245 speeding ticket on my way home - 80 in a 50 zone (km/hr, metric here in canada) as i was coming off a highway ramp. not my day.  edit: added metric note, i usually drive like a granny.
